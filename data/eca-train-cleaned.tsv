Jobs by the hand he led him out of the worshipful crowd and walked him up to a hill where there was a well and a small pond we sit down and he pulls out this straight razor I'm thinking he's a nutcase and begin to worry Then he pulls out a bar of soap-I had long hair at the time-and he lathered up my hair and shaved my head.

The Atari experience helped shape Jobs's approach to business and design He appreciated the user-friendliness of Atari's insert-quarter-avoid-Klingons games that simplicity rubbed off on him and made him a very focused product person said Ron Wayne.

His argument was that a great engineer would be remembered only if he teamed with a great marketer and this required him to commit his designs to the partnership Jobs was so impressed and grateful that he offered Wayne a 10% stake in the new partnership turning him into a tie-breaker if Jobs and Wozniak disagreed over an issue.

Jobs and Wozniak had no personal assets but Wayne (who worried about a global financial Armageddon) kept gold coins hidden in his mattress Because they had structured Apple as a simple partnership rather than a corporation the partners would be personally liable for the debts and Wayne was afraid potential creditors would go after him.

What bothered him more was that Jobs knew nothing about marketing and seemed content to peddle his product to individual stores one by one.	O B-EMO O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust

He had just come up with a brilliant algorithm that could draw circles and ovals onscreen quickly The math for making circles usually required calculating square roots which the 68000 microprocessor didn't support But Atkinson did a workaround based on the fact that the sum of a sequence of odd numbers produces a sequence of perfect squares (for example 1 + 3 = 4 1 + 3 + 5 = 9 etc Hertzfeld recalled that when Atkinson fired up his demo everyone was impressed except Jobs.

Atkinson had been left out of the publicity interviews for the Lisa launch and he marched into Jobs's hotel room and threatened to quit Jobs tried to minimize the slight but Atkinson refused to be mollified Jobs got annoyed.

But by the time the Lisa was ready to ship in the spring of 1983 it was clear that the Twiggy was buggy Because the Lisa also came with a hard-disk drive this was not a complete disaster But the Mac had no hard disk so it faced a crisis The Mac team was beginning to panic said Hertzfeld.

The explanation that Sculley might buy a lot of Macintoshes for Pepsi sounded a little bit fishy to me Hertzfeld recalled but he and Susan Kare created a screen of Pepsi caps and cans that danced around with the Apple logo Hertzfeld was so excited he began waving his arms around during the demo but Sculley seemed underwhelmed.

So Jobs promised them don't worry I'm not going to let him get away with it But in the end Sculley prevailed Even twenty-five years later Jobs seethed when recalling the decision: It's the main reason the Macintosh sales slowed and Microsoft got to dominate the market.

Despite their mutual wariness both teams were excited by the prospect that Microsoft would create graphical software for the Macintosh that would take personal computing into a new realm and they went to dinner at a fancy restaurant to celebrate.

But this arrangement upset competing software makers In addition it seemed that some of Microsoft's programs might be late So Jobs invoked a provision in his deal with Microsoft and decided not to bundle its software Microsoft would have to scramble to distribute its software as products sold directly to consumers.

He couldn't understand how this had all come about One day he was perfectly content playing at home having three best friends for life sliding down banisters trying to stand on his tiptoes to see right across Berlin and now he was stuck here in this cold nasty house with three whispering maids and a waiter who was both unhappy and angry where no one looked as if they could ever be cheerful again.

'Bruno I want you to go upstairs and unpack and I want you to do it now ' said Mother in an unfriendly voice and he knew that she meant business so he turned round and marched away without another word He could feel tears springing up behind his eyes but he was determined that he wouldn't allow them to appear.

Just at that moment there was a creak outside in the hallway and Bruno looked up to see the door of Mother and Father's room opening slightly He froze unable to move for a moment Mother was still downstairs which meant that Father was in there and he might have heard everything that Bruno had just said He watched the door hardly daring to breathe wondering whether Father might come through it and take him downstairs for a serious talking-to.

'One of your father's soldiers I suppose ' said Maria who had stood up very straight when the young man appeared and held her hands before her like a person in prayer She had stared down at the ground rather than at his face as if she was afraid she might be turned to stone if she looked directly at him she only relaxed when he had gone 'We'll get to know them in time.'

'Of course I did ' she replied 'You don't think I'd have left them at home Why it could be weeks before we're back there again 'Weeks ' said Bruno sounding disappointed but secretly pleased because he'd resigned himself to the idea of spending a month there 'Do you really think so	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O B-EMO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness
'Of course ' said Gretel who always spoke of Father as if he could never do any wrong and never got angry and always came in to kiss her goodnight before she went to sleep which if Bruno was to be really fair and not just sad about moving houses he would have admitted Father did for him too.

'And I miss Hilda and Isobel and Louise ' said Gretel and Bruno tried to remember which of those three girls was the monster 'I don't think the other children look at all friendly ' said Bruno and Gretel immediately stopped putting one of her more terrifying dolls on a shelf and turned round to stare at him.

There wasn't any grass after the fence in fact there was no greenery anywhere to be seen in the distance Instead the ground was  made of a sand-like substance and as far as she could make out there was nothing but low huts and large square buildings dotted around and one or two smoke stacks in the distance She opened her mouth to say something but when she did she realized that she couldn't find any words to express her surprise and so she did the only sensible thing she could think of and closed it again.

'Look over there ' said Bruno and Gretel followed the direction of the finger he was pointing and saw emerging from a hut in the distance a group of children huddled together and being shouted at by a group of soldiers The more they were shouted at the closer they huddled together but then one of the soldiers lunged towards them and they separated and seemed to do what he had wanted them to do all along which was to stand in a single line When they did the soldiers all started to laugh and applaud them.

Bruno walked slowly down the stairs and hesitated for a moment outside the door He felt sad that Father had not come up to say hello to him in the hour or so that he had been here but it had been explained to him on many occasions just how busy Father was and that he couldn't be disturbed by silly things like saying hello to him all the time But the soldiers had left now and he thought it would be all right if he knocked on the door.

'What do I think ' asked Bruno 'What do I think of what ' 'Of your new home Do you like it ' 'No ' said Bruno quickly because he always tried to be honest and knew that if he hesitated even for a moment then he wouldn't have the nerve to say what he really thought 'I think we should go home ' he added bravely Father's smile faded only a little and he glanced down at his letter for a moment before looking back up again as if he wanted to consider his reply carefully 'Well we are home Bruno ' he said finally in a gentle voice 'Out-With is our new home.'

'I want to go home ' said Bruno He could feel tears welling up behind his eyes and wanted nothing more than for Father to realize just how awful a place Out-With really was and agree that it was time to leave.

Bruno looked around His gaze landed on the window in the corner of the room and through it he could see the awful landscape beyond 'Did you do something wrong ' he asked after a moment 'Something that  made the Fury angry ' 'Me ' said Father looking at him in surprise 'What do you mean	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O O O O	surprise
'Did you do something bad in work I know that everyone says you're an important man and that the Fury has big things in mind for you but he'd hardly send you to a place like this if you hadn't done something that he wanted to punish you for Father laughed which upset Bruno even more there was nothing that made him more angry than when a grown-up laughed at him for not knowing something especially when he was trying to find out the answer by asking questions.

He tensed slightly and got ready to make a run for it if necessary But nothing seemed to be making Father angry today—and if Bruno was honest with himself he would have admitted that Father rarely became angry he became quiet and distant and always had his way in the end anyway—and rather than shouting at him or chasing him around the house he simply shook his head and indicated that their debate was at an end.

'Go to your room Bruno ' he said in such a quiet voice that Bruno knew that he meant business now so he stood up tears of frustration forming in his eyes He walked towards the door but before opening it he turned round and asked one final question 'Father ' he began.

'Well of course it's important ' said Bruno irritably as if she was just being deliberately difficult 'You're part of the family aren't you ' 'I'm not sure whether your father would agree with that ' said Maria allowing herself a smile because she was touched by what he had just said.

'Stupid Father ' he added under his breath Maria's eyes opened wide and she took a step towards him her hands covering her mouth for a moment in horror She looked round to make sure that no one was listening to them and had heard what Bruno had just said 'You mustn't say that ' she said 'You must never say something like that about your father.'

'I still think he's  made a terrible mistake ' said Bruno quietly after a few minutes when he felt as if he wanted to apologize for his sister's behaviour but didn't know whether that was the right thing to do or not Situations like that always  made Bruno feel very uncomfortable because in his heart he knew that there was no reason to be impolite to someone even if they did work for you There was such a thing as manners after all.

'No ' she insisted her voice becoming grating now as she appealed to him 'Just keep quiet about it Bruno Don't you know how much trouble you could cause For all of us ' Bruno stared at her There was something in her eyes a sort of frenzied worry that he had never seen there before and that unsettled him.

'Well how do you know ' asked Bruno quickly growing irritable now despite the fact that this was the same man who had come out to pick him up off the ground and brought him in and taken care of him 'You're not a doctor Pavel stopped peeling the carrots for a moment and looked across the table at Bruno his head held low his eyes looking up as if he were wondering what to say to such a thing He sighed and seemed to consider it for quite a long time before saying 'Yes I am Bruno stared at him in surprise This didn't make any sense to him 'But you're a waiter ' he said slowly 'And you peel the vegetables for dinner How can you be a doctor too	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU O O O O O B-EMO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise
Pavel turned his body slightly in their direction but didn't lift his head 'The wound has been cleaned ' he said quietly not answering Bruno's question 'There's nothing to worry about.'	O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O	fear
'Don't argue with me—go to your room ' she insisted and Bruno stepped off the chair putting his weight on what he had decided to call his bad leg and it hurt a little He turned and left the room but was still able to hear Mother saying thank you to Pavel as he walked towards the stairs and this  made Bruno happy because surely it was obvious to everyone that if it hadn't been for him he would have bled to death.

Grandfather had spent his entire life running a restaurant in the centre of town and one of his employees was the father of Bruno's friend Martin who worked there as a chef Although Grandfather no longer cooked or waited on tables in the restaurant himself he spent most of his days there sitting at the bar in the afternoon talking to the customers eating his meals there in the evening and staying until closing time laughing with his friends.

Father always stayed to listen and Bruno did too because there was nothing he liked more than hearing Grandmother break into her full voice and soak up the applause of the guests at the end Plus La Vie en Rose gave him chills and  made the tiny hairs on the back of his neck stand on end.

Grandfather was very proud of his son when he saw him in his new uniform but Grandmother was the only one who seemed unimpressed After dinner had been served and after she and Gretel and Bruno had performed their latest production she sat down sadly in one of the armchairs and looked at Father shaking her head as if he were a huge disappointment to her.

'He did come to harm Matthias ' insisted Grandmother 'Take a look at him for your evidence 'And now look at you ' continued Grandfather ignoring her 'It makes me so proud to see you elevated to such a responsible position Helping your country reclaim her pride after all the great wrongs that were done to her The punishments above and beyond—''Oh will you listen to yourself ' cried Grandmother 'Which one of you is the most foolish I wonder	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness
'That's all you soldiers are interested in anyway ' Grandmother said ignoring the children altogether 'Looking handsome in your fine uniforms Dressing up and doing the terrible terrible things you do It makes me ashamed But I blame myself Ralf not you.'

Bruno hadn't seen much of Grandmother after that and hadn't even had a chance to say goodbye to her before they moved to Out-With but he missed her very much and decided to write her a letter.

The walk along the fence took Bruno a lot longer than he expected it seemed to stretch on and on for several miles He walked and walked and when he looked back the house that he was living in became smaller and smaller until it vanished from sight altogether During all this time he never saw anyone anywhere close to the fence nor did he find any doors to let him inside and he started to despair that his exploration was going to be entirely unsuccessful In fact although the fence continued as far as the eye could see the huts and buildings and smoke stacks were disappearing in the distance behind him and the fence seemed to be separating him from nothing but open space.

Shmuel thought about it and looked down at his fingers and they wiggled in the air as if he was trying to calculate 'I'm nine ' he said 'My birthday is April the fifteenth nineteen thirty-four Bruno stared at him in surprise 'What did you say ' he asked 'I said my birthday is April the fifteenth nineteen thirty-four.'

Bruno's eyes opened wide and his mouth  made the shape of an O 'I don't believe it ' he said 'Why not ' asked Shmuel 'No ' said Bruno shaking his head quickly 'I don't mean I don't believe you I mean I'm surprised that's all Because my birthday is April the fifteenth too.

'Do you have many friends ' asked Bruno cocking his head a little to the side as he waited for an answer 'Oh yes ' said Shmuel 'Well sort of Bruno frowned He had hoped that Shmuel might have said no as it would give them something else in common ' Close friends ' he asked.

'The Fury has something he wants to discuss with me ' said Father who was allowed to interrupt Mother even if no one else was I just got a phone call this afternoon The only time he can make it is Thursday evening and he's invited himself to dinner Mother's eyes opened wide and her mouth  made the shape of an O Bruno stared at her and wondered whether this was what he looked like when he was surprised about something.

An hour before the Fury was due to arrive Gretel and Bruno were brought downstairs where they received a rare invitation into Father's office Gretel was wearing a white dress and knee socks and her hair had been twisted into corkscrew curls Bruno was wearing a pair of dark brown shorts a plain white shirt and a dark brown tie He had a new pair of shoes for the occasion and was very proud of them even though they were too small for him and were pinching his feet and making it difficult for him to walk All these preparations and fine clothes seemed a little extravagant all the same because Bruno and Gretel weren't even invited to dinner they had eaten an hour earlier.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O B-EMO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness
The woman standing beside him however was quite the most beautiful woman he had ever seen in his life She had blonde hair and very red lips and while the Fury spoke to Mother she turned and looked at Bruno and smiled making him go red with embarrassment.

The matter was resolved quickly however as the Fury who was the rudest guest Bruno had ever witnessed turned round and walked directly into the dining room and promptly sat down at the head of the table—in Father's seat —without another word A little flustered Mother and Father followed him inside and Mother gave instructions to Lars that he could start heating up the soup.

'We wore the armbands for a few months ' he said 'And then things changed again I came home one day and Mama said we couldn't live in our house any more—' 'That happened to me too ' shouted Bruno delighted that he wasn't the only boy who'd been forced to move.

'We lived there for some more months ' continued Shmuel 'all of us in that one room There was one small window in it but I didn't like to look out of it because then I would see the wall and I hated the wall because our real home was on the other side of it And this part of town was the bad part because it was always noisy and it was impossible to sleep And I hated Luka who was the boy who kept hitting me even when I did nothing wrong.'

Bruno was about to leave when the food caught his eye and a question came into his mind that had been bothering him for some time He hadn't been able to think of anyone to ask before but this seemed like a perfect moment and the perfect person 'Maria ' he said 'can I ask you a question ' The maid turned round and looked at him in surprise 'Of course Master Bruno ' she said.

'He said he was a doctor ' said Bruno 'Which didn't seem right at all He's not a doctor is he ' 'No ' said Maria shaking her head 'No he's not a doctor He's a waiter 'I knew it ' said Bruno feeling very pleased with himself 'Why did he lie to me then It doesn't make any sense.'

'Herr Liszt won't let us read poetry or plays ' complained Bruno during the main course As they had company for dinner the family were dressed formally—Father in his uniform Mother in a green dress that set off her eyes and Gretel and Bruno in the clothes they wore to church when they lived in Berlin 'I asked him if we could read them just one day a week but he said no not while he was in charge of our education.'

'I enjoyed history very much when I was a boy ' said Lieutenant Kotler after a few silent moments 'And although my father was a professor of literature at the university I preferred the social sciences to the arts 'I didn't know that Kurt ' said Mother turning to look at him for a moment 'Does he still teach then ' 'I suppose so ' said Lieutenant Kotler 'I don't really know 'Well how could you not know ' she asked frowning at him 'Don't you keep in touch with him	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O O O O O O O O O	sadness
'I asked you where he went ' he repeated 'Your father The professor of literature Where did he go when he left Germany ' Lieutenant Kotler's face grew a little red and he stuttered somewhat as he spoke I believe… I believe he is currently in Switzerland ' he said finally 'The last I heard he was teaching at a university in Berne.'

Bruno watched him hoping he was feeling all right although he managed to release the cork without any accidents But after he had filled Father's glass and turned to refill Lieutenant Kotler's he lost his grip of the bottle somehow and it fell crashing glug-glug-glugging its contents out directly onto the young man's lap What happened then was both unexpected and extremely unpleasant Lieutenant Kotler grew very angry with Pavel and no one—not Bruno not Gretel not Mother and not even Father—stepped in to stop him doing what he did next even though none of them could watch Even though it  made Bruno cry and Gretel grow pale.

'I'm reading ' said Bruno 'What are you reading ' she asked him and rather than answer he simply turned the cover towards her so she could see for herself She  made a raspberry sound through her lips and some of her spit landed on Bruno's face 'Boring ' she said in a sing-song voice 'It's not boring at all ' said Bruno 'It's an adventure It's better than dolls that's for sure Gretel didn't rise to the bait on that one 'What are you doing ' she repeated irritating Bruno even further I told you I'm trying to read ' he said in a grumpy voice 'If some people would just let me.'

For several weeks the rain was on and off and on and off and Bruno and Shmuel did not see as much of each other as they would have liked When they did meet Bruno found that he was starting to worry about his friend because he seemed to be getting even thinner by the day and his face was growing more and more grey.

'He's not going to mind ' said Bruno who was confused by how anxious Shmuel seemed 'It's only food 'I can't ' said Shmuel shaking his head and looking as if he was going to cry 'He'll come back I know he will ' he continued his sentences running quickly together 'I should have eaten them when you offered them now it's too late if I take them he'll come in and—'	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O	sadness
'Shmuel Here ' said Bruno stepping forward and putting the slices in his friend's hand 'Just eat them There's lots left for our tea—you don't have to worry about that The boy stared at the food in his hand for a moment and then looked up at Bruno with wide and grateful but terrified eyes He threw one more glance in the direction of the door and then seemed to make a decision because he thrust all three slices into his mouth in one go and gobbled them down in twenty seconds flat.

'You have been eating ' insisted Lieutenant Kotler 'Did you steal something from that fridge ' Shmuel opened his mouth and closed it He opened it again and tried to find words but there were none He looked towards Bruno his eyes pleading for help 'Answer me ' shouted Lieutenant Kotler 'Did you steal something from that fridge	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O O O O O O O O O	anger
Bruno hadn't seen his grandmother since leaving Berlin but he had thought about her every day The things he remembered most about her were the productions that she and he and Gretel performed at Christmas and birthdays and how she always had the perfect costume to suit whatever role he played When he thought that they would never be able to do that again it  made him very sad indeed.

The two days they spent in Berlin were also very sad ones There was the funeral and Bruno and Gretel and Father and Mother and Grandfather sat in the front row Father wearing his most impressive uniform the starched and pressed one with the decorations Father was particularly sad Mother told Bruno because he had fought with Grandmother and they hadn't  made it up before she died.

There were a lot of wreaths delivered to the church and Father was proud of the fact that one of them had been sent by the Fury but when Mother heard she said that Grandmother would turn in her grave if she knew it was there.

There was also the fact that Lieutenant Kotler had been transferred away from Out-With and wasn't around to make Bruno feel angry and upset all the time (His departure had come about very suddenly and there had been a lot of shouting between Father and Mother about it late at night but he was gone that was for sure and he wasn't coming back Gretel was inconsolable That was something else to be happy about: no one called him 'little man' any more.

He enjoyed walking along the fence every afternoon and was pleased to see that his friend seemed a lot happier these days and his eyes didn't seem so sunken although his body was still ridiculously skinny and his face unpleasantly grey.

'No ' said Bruno 'I don't understand why we're not allowed on the other side of it What's so wrong with us that we can't go over there and play ' Gretel stared at him and then suddenly started laughing only stopping when she saw that Bruno was being perfectly serious.

'We're the opposite ' said Gretel answering quickly and sounding a lot more satisfied with this answer 'Yes that's it We're the opposite 'All right ' said Bruno pleased that he had it settled in his head at last 'And the Opposite live on this side of the fence and the Jews live on that.'

It turned out that both Gretel and Bruno had lice in their hair and Gretel had to be treated with a special shampoo that smelled horrible and afterwards she sat in her room for hours on end crying her eyes out.

Bruno had the shampoo as well but then Father decided that the best thing was for him to start afresh and he got a razor and shaved all Bruno's hair off which  made Bruno cry It didn't take long and he hated seeing all his hair float down from his head and land on the floor at his feet but Father said it had to be done.

When he saw his friend the next day Shmuel started to laugh at Bruno's appearance which didn't do a lot for his dwindling self-confidence 'I look just like you now ' said Bruno sadly as if this was a terrible thing to admit.

Over the course of the next few weeks Mother seemed increasingly unhappy with life at Out-With and Bruno understood perfectly well why that might be After all when they'd first arrived he had hated it due to the fact that it was nothing like home and lacked such things as three best friends for life But that had changed for him over time mostly due to Shmuel who had become more important to him than Karl or Daniel or Martin had ever been But Mother didn't have a Shmuel of her own There was no one for her to talk to and the only person who she had been remotely friendly with—the young Lieutenant Kotler—had been transferred somewhere else.

But on the other hand he'd grown used to life at Out-With: he didn't mind Herr Liszt he'd become much friendlier with Maria than he ever had been back in Berlin Gretel was still going through a phase and keeping out of his way (and she didn't seem to be quite so much of a Hopeless Case any more) and his afternoon conversations with Shmuel filled him with happiness.

Nothing at all changed for a few weeks life went on as normal Father spent most of his time either in his office or on the other side of the fence Mother kept very quiet during the day and was having an awful lot more of her afternoon naps some of them not even in the afternoon but before lunch and Bruno was worried for her health because he'd never known anyone need quite so many medicinal sherries Gretel stayed in her room concentrating on the various maps she had pasted on the walls and consulting the newspapers for hours at a time before moving the pins around a little (Herr Liszt was particularly pleased with her for doing this.)

And Bruno did exactly what was asked of him and caused no chaos at all and enjoyed the fact that he had one secret friend whom no one knew about Then one day Father summoned Bruno and Gretel into his office and informed them of the changes that were to come.

From time to time we landed at various islands where we sold or exchanged our merchandise and one day when the wind dropped suddenly we found ourselves becalmed close to a small island like a green meadow which only rose slightly above the surface of the water Our sails were furled and the captain gave permission to all who wished to land for a while and amuse themselves I was among the number but when after strolling about for some time we lighted a fire and sat down to enjoy the repast which we had brought with us we were startled by a sudden and violent trembling of the island while at the same moment those left upon the ship set up an outcry bidding us come on board for our lives since what we had taken for an island was nothing but the back of a sleeping whale Those who were nearest to the boat threw themselves into it others sprang into the sea but before I could save myself the whale plunged suddenly into the depths of the ocean leaving me clinging to a piece of the wood which we had brought to make our fire Meanwhile a breeze had sprung up and in the confusion that ensued on board our vessel in hoisting the sails and taking up those who were in the boat and clinging to its sides no one missed me and I was left at the mercy of the waves All that day I floated up and down now beaten this way now that and when night fell I despaired for my life but weary and spent as I was I clung to my frail support and great was my joy when the morning light showed me that I had drifted against an island.

How long I slept I know not but when I opened my eyes and started to my feet I perceived with horror that I was alone and that the ship was gone I rushed to and fro like one distracted uttering cries of despair and when from the shore I saw the vessel under full sail just disappearing upon the horizon I wished bitterly enough that I had been content to stay at home in safety But since wishes could do me no good I presently took courage and looked about me for a means of escape When I had climbed a tall tree I first of all directed my anxious glances towards the sea but finding nothing hopeful there I turned landward and my curiosity was excited by a huge dazzling white object so far off that I could not make out what it might be.

At first when Frank called she did not have much to say She was gracious but the burden of conversation fell on her husband Cowperwood watched the varying expression of her face from time to time and if she had been at all psychic she must have felt something Fortunately she was not Semple talked to him pleasantly because in the first place Frank was becoming financially significant was suave and ingratiating and in the next place he was anxious to get richer and somehow Frank represented progress to him in that line One spring evening they sat on the porch and talked--nothing very important--slavery street-cars the panic--it was on then that of 1857--the development of the West.

In spite of her fears and her uncertainty Lillian Semple accepted his attentions and interest because equally in spite of herself she was drawn to him One night when she was going to bed she stopped in front of her dressing table and looked at her face and her bare neck and arms They were very pretty A subtle something came over her as she surveyed her long peculiarly shaded hair She thought of young Cowperwood and then was chilled and shamed by the vision of the late Mr Semple and the force and quality of public opinion.

Cowperwood had implicit faith in the future of the street railway In support of this belief he risked all he could spare on new issues of stock shares in new companies He wanted to be on the inside wherever possible always though this was a little difficult in the matter of the street-railways he having been so young when they started and not having yet arranged his financial connections to make them count for much.

Those who recall the early years of their married life can best realize the subtle changes which this new condition brought to Frank for like all who accept the hymeneal yoke he was influenced to a certain extent by the things with which he surrounded himself Primarily from certain traits of his character one would have imagined him called to be a citizen of eminent respectability and worth He appeared to be an ideal home man He delighted to return to his wife in the evenings leaving the crowded downtown section where traffic clamored and men hurried Here he could feel that he was well-stationed and physically happy in life The thought of the dinner-table with candles upon it (his idea) the thought of Lillian in a trailing gown of pale-blue or green silk--he liked her in those colors the thought of a large fireplace flaming with solid lengths of cord-wood and Lillian snuggling in his arms gripped his immature imagination As has been said before he cared nothing for books but life pictures trees physical contact--these in spite of his shrewd and already gripping financial calculations held him To live richly joyously fully--his whole nature craved that.

And Mrs Cowperwood in spite of the difference in their years appeared to be a fit mate for him at this time She was once awakened and for the time being clinging responsive dreamy His mood and hers was for a baby and in a little while that happy expectation was whispered to him by her She had half fancied that her previous barrenness was due to herself and was rather surprised and delighted at the proof that it was not so It opened new possibilities--a seemingly glorious future of which she was not afraid He liked it the idea of self-duplication.

Stener stood there ridiculously meditating when as a matter of fact his very financial blood was oozing away Yet he was afraid to act He was afraid of Mollenhauer afraid of Cowperwood afraid of life and of himself The thought of panic loss was not so much a definite thing connected with his own property his money as it was with his social and political standing in the community.

That was why he had been so ready to let Cowperwood act for him and now when he should have seen more clearly than ever the significance of what Cowperwood was proposing he was frightened and his reason obscured by such things as Mollenhauer's probable opposition and rage Cowperwood's possible failure his own inability to face a real crisis Cowperwood's innate financial ability did not reassure Stener in this hour.

"""Good God how you talk "" exploded Cowperwood angrily looking at him with ill-concealed contempt ""Go ahead See Mollenhauer Let him tell you how to cut your own throat for his benefit It won't be right to loan me three hundred thousand dollars more but it will be right to let the five hundred thousand dollars you have loaned stand unprotected and lose it That's right isn't it That's just what you propose to do--lose it and everything else besides I want to tell you what it is George--you've lost your mind."

Stener was just about to make another weak rejoinder when the door from the outer office opened and Albert Stires Stener's chief clerk entered Stener was too flustered to really pay any attention to Stires for the moment but Cowperwood took matters in his own hands.

Now with us whenever the weather was doubtful or squally-looking we shortened sail and kept it fast till better weather came along being quite careless whether we made one mile a day or one hundred But just because nobody took any notice of our progress as the days passed we were occasionally startled to find how far we had really got This was certainly the case with all of us forward even to me who had some experience so well used had I now become to the leisurely way of getting along.

One afternoon when Bruno came home from school he was surprised to find Maria the family's maid—who always kept her head bowed and never looked up from the carpet—standing in his bedroom pulling all his belongings out of the wardrobe and packing them in four large wooden crates even the things he'd hidden at the back that belonged to him and were nobody else's business.

'What are you doing ' he asked in as polite a tone as he could muster for although he wasn't happy to come home and find someone going through his possessions his mother had always told him that he was to treat Maria respectfully and not just imitate the Way Father spoke to her 'You take your hands off my things.'

Mother had walked into her own bedroom by then but Lars the butler was in there packing her things too She sighed and threw her hands in the air in frustration before marching back to the staircase followed by Bruno who wasn't going to let the matter drop without an explanation.

Bruno ran downstairs and even passed her out on the staircase so that he was waiting in the dining room when she arrived He looked at her without saying anything for a moment and thought to himself that she couldn't have applied her make-up correctly that morning because the rims of her eyes were more red than usual like his own after he'd been causing chaos and got into trouble and ended up crying.

"'What is ' he asked 'Am I being sent away '	'No not just you ' she said looking as if she might smile for a moment but thinking better of it We all are Your father and I Gretel and you All four of us Bruno thought about this and frowned He wasn't particularly bothered if Gretel was being sent away because she was a Hopeless Case and caused nothing but trouble for him But it seemed a little unfair that they all had to go with her."

Mother sighed and looked around the room as if she might never see it again It was a very beautiful house and had five floors in total if you included the basement where Cook  made all the food and Maria and Lars sat at the table arguing with each other and calling each other names that you weren't supposed to use And if you added in the little room at the top of the house with the slanted windows where Bruno could see right across Berlin if he stood up on his tiptoes and held onto the frame tightly.

'Oh my ' said Mother with a laugh although it was a strange kind of laugh because she didn't look happy and turned away from Bruno as if she didn't want him to see her face 'Yes Bruno ' she said 'It's more than a mile away Quite a lot more than that in fact.'

Bruno's eyes opened wide and his mouth  made the shape of an O He felt his arms stretching out at his sides like they did whenever something surprised him 'You don't mean we're leaving Berlin ' he asked gasping for air as he got the words out 'I'm afraid so ' said Mother nodding her head sadly.

'Say goodbye to them ' he asked staring at her in surprise 'Say goodbye to them ' he repeated spluttering out the words as if his mouth was full of biscuits that he'd munched into tiny pieces but not actually swallowed yet 'Say goodbye to Karl and Daniel and Martin ' he continued his voice coming dangerously close to shouting which was not allowed indoors 'But they're my three best friends for life	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger

'Everyone has to do that ' said Mother 'It keeps us safe And who knows maybe we'll be in less danger if we move away Now I need you to go upstairs and help Maria with your packing We don't have as much time to prepare as I would have liked thanks to some people Bruno nodded and walked away sadly knowing that 'some people' was a grown-up's word for 'Father' and one that he wasn't supposed to use himself.

When he first saw their new house Bruno's eyes opened wide his mouth  made the shape of an O and his arms stretched out at his sides once again Everything about it seemed to be the exact opposite of their old home and he couldn't believe that they were really going to live there.

Bruno had a pain in his stomach and he could feel something growing inside him something that when it worked its way up from the lowest depths inside him to the outside world would either make him shout and scream that the whole thing was wrong and unfair and a big mistake for which somebody would pay one of these days or just make him burst into tears instead.

He couldn't understand how this had all come about One day he was perfectly content playing at home having three best friends for life sliding down banisters trying to stand on his tiptoes to see right across Berlin and now he was stuck here in this cold nasty house with three whispering maids and a waiter who was both unhappy and angry where no one looked as if they could ever be cheerful again.

'Bruno I want you to go upstairs and unpack and I want you to do it now ' said Mother in an unfriendly voice and he knew that she meant business so he turned round and marched away without another word He could feel tears springing up behind his eyes but he was determined that he wouldn't allow them to appear.

Just at that moment there was a creak outside in the hallway and Bruno looked up to see the door of Mother and Father's room opening slightly He froze unable to move for a moment Mother was still downstairs which meant that Father was in there and he might have heard everything that Bruno had just said He watched the door hardly daring to breathe wondering whether Father might come through it and take him downstairs for a serious talking-to.

'One of your father's soldiers I suppose ' said Maria who had stood up very straight when the young man appeared and held her hands before her like a person in prayer She had stared down at the ground rather than at his face as if she was afraid she might be turned to stone if she looked directly at him she only relaxed when he had gone 'We'll get to know them in time.'

'I don't see what else there is to do other than that ' said Bruno sadly 'I don't even think there's going to be anyone to play with other than Gretel and what fun is that after all She's a Hopeless Case.'

'Of course I did ' she replied 'You don't think I'd have left them at home Why it could be weeks before we're back there again 'Weeks ' said Bruno sounding disappointed but secretly pleased because he'd resigned himself to the idea of spending a month there 'Do you really think so	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O B-EMO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness
'Of course ' said Gretel who always spoke of Father as if he could never do any wrong and never got angry and always came in to kiss her goodnight before she went to sleep which if Bruno was to be really fair and not just sad about moving houses he would have admitted Father did for him too.

'And I miss Hilda and Isobel and Louise ' said Gretel and Bruno tried to remember which of those three girls was the monster 'I don't think the other children look at all friendly ' said Bruno and Gretel immediately stopped putting one of her more terrifying dolls on a shelf and turned round to stare at him.

There wasn't any grass after the fence in fact there was no greenery anywhere to be seen in the distance Instead the ground was  made of a sand-like substance and as far as she could make out there was nothing but low huts and large square buildings dotted around and one or two smoke stacks in the distance She opened her mouth to say something but when she did she realized that she couldn't find any words to express her surprise and so she did the only sensible thing she could think of and closed it again.

'Look over there ' said Bruno and Gretel followed the direction of the finger he was pointing and saw emerging from a hut in the distance a group of children huddled together and being shouted at by a group of soldiers The more they were shouted at the closer they huddled together but then one of the soldiers lunged towards them and they separated and seemed to do what he had wanted them to do all along which was to stand in a single line When they did the soldiers all started to laugh and applaud them.

Bruno walked slowly down the stairs and hesitated for a moment outside the door He felt sad that Father had not come up to say hello to him in the hour or so that he had been here but it had been explained to him on many occasions just how busy Father was and that he couldn't be disturbed by silly things like saying hello to him all the time But the soldiers had left now and he thought it would be all right if he knocked on the door.

'What do I think ' asked Bruno 'What do I think of what ' 'Of your new home Do you like it ' 'No ' said Bruno quickly because he always tried to be honest and knew that if he hesitated even for a moment then he wouldn't have the nerve to say what he really thought 'I think we should go home ' he added bravely Father's smile faded only a little and he glanced down at his letter for a moment before looking back up again as if he wanted to consider his reply carefully 'Well we are home Bruno ' he said finally in a gentle voice 'Out-With is our new home.'

'Did you do something bad in work I know that everyone says you're an important man and that the Fury has big things in mind for you but he'd hardly send you to a place like this if you hadn't done something that he wanted to punish you for Father laughed which upset Bruno even more there was nothing that made him more angry than when a grown-up laughed at him for not knowing something especially when he was trying to find out the answer by asking questions.

He tensed slightly and got ready to make a run for it if necessary But nothing seemed to be making Father angry today—and if Bruno was honest with himself he would have admitted that Father rarely became angry he became quiet and distant and always had his way in the end anyway—and rather than shouting at him or chasing him around the house he simply shook his head and indicated that their debate was at an end.

'Because your father is a good man ' said Maria 'A very good man He takes care of all of us 'Bringing us all the way out here to the middle of nowhere you mean Is that taking care of us ' 'There are many things your father has done ' she said 'Many things of which you should be proud If it wasn't for your father where would I be now after all	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness
'My mother knew your father when he was just a boy of your age ' said Maria after a few moments 'She worked for your grandmother She was a dresser for her when she toured Germany as a younger woman She arranged all the clothes for her concerts—washed them ironed them repaired them Magnificent gowns all of them And the stitching Bruno Like art work every design You don't find dressmakers like that these days She shook her head and smiled at the memory as Bruno listened patiently 'She  made sure that they were all laid out and ready whenever your grandmother arrived in her dressing room before a show And after your grandmother retired of course my mother stayed friendly with her and received a small pension but times were hard then and your father offered me a job the first I had ever had A few months later my mother became very sick and she needed a lot of hospital care and your father arranged it all even though he was not obliged to He paid for it out of his own pocket because she had been a friend to his mother And he took me into his household for the same reason And when she died he paid all the expenses for her funeral too So don't you ever call your father stupid Bruno Not around me I won't allow it.'

Bruno bit his lip He had hoped that Maria would take his side in the campaign to get away from Out-With but he could see where her loyalties really lay And he had to admit that he was rather proud of his father when he heard that story.

'I still think he's  made a terrible mistake ' said Bruno quietly after a few minutes when he felt as if he wanted to apologize for his sister's behaviour but didn't know whether that was the right thing to do or not Situations like that always  made Bruno feel very uncomfortable because in his heart he knew that there was no reason to be impolite to someone even if they did work for you There was such a thing as manners after all.

'No ' she insisted her voice becoming grating now as she appealed to him 'Just keep quiet about it Bruno Don't you know how much trouble you could cause For all of us ' Bruno stared at her There was something in her eyes a sort of frenzied worry that he had never seen there before and that unsettled him.

In the distance he could see the gate that led to the road that led to the train station that led home but the idea of going there the idea of running away and being left on his own without anyone at all was even more unpleasant to him than the idea of staying.

Lieutenant Kotler was deep in conversation with Gretel and whatever he was saying must have been terribly funny because she was laughing loudly and twirling her hair around her fingers into ringlets ello ' said Bruno as he approached them and Gretel looked at him irritably 'What do you want ' she asked 'I don't want anything ' snapped Bruno glaring at her 'I just came over to say hello.'

'Stop it Kurt ' said Gretel drying her eyes 'He doesn't understand you He's only nine 'Oh will you be quiet please ' shouted Bruno staring at his sister in irritation It was bad enough having to come out here and ask for a favour from Lieutenant Kotler but it only  made things worse when his own sister teased him all the way through it.

'Well how do you know ' asked Bruno quickly growing irritable now despite the fact that this was the same man who had come out to pick him up off the ground and brought him in and taken care of him 'You're not a doctor Pavel stopped peeling the carrots for a moment and looked across the table at Bruno his head held low his eyes looking up as if he were wondering what to say to such a thing He sighed and seemed to consider it for quite a long time before saying 'Yes I am Bruno stared at him in surprise This didn't make any sense to him 'But you're a waiter ' he said slowly 'And you peel the vegetables for dinner How can you be a doctor too	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU O O O O O B-EMO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise

'Don't argue with me—go to your room ' she insisted and Bruno stepped off the chair putting his weight on what he had decided to call his bad leg and it hurt a little He turned and left the room but was still able to hear Mother saying thank you to Pavel as he walked towards the stairs and this  made Bruno happy because surely it was obvious to everyone that if it hadn't been for him he would have bled to death.

Grandfather had spent his entire life running a restaurant in the centre of town and one of his employees was the father of Bruno's friend Martin who worked there as a chef Although Grandfather no longer cooked or waited on tables in the restaurant himself he spent most of his days there sitting at the bar in the afternoon talking to the customers eating his meals there in the evening and staying until closing time laughing with his friends.

Father always stayed to listen and Bruno did too because there was nothing he liked more than hearing Grandmother break into her full voice and soak up the applause of the guests at the end Plus La Vie en Rose gave him chills and  made the tiny hairs on the back of his neck stand on end.

Grandfather was very proud of his son when he saw him in his new uniform but Grandmother was the only one who seemed unimpressed After dinner had been served and after she and Gretel and Bruno had performed their latest production she sat down sadly in one of the armchairs and looked at Father shaking her head as if he were a huge disappointment to her.

The walk along the fence took Bruno a lot longer than he expected it seemed to stretch on and on for several miles He walked and walked and when he looked back the house that he was living in became smaller and smaller until it vanished from sight altogether During all this time he never saw anyone anywhere close to the fence nor did he find any doors to let him inside and he started to despair that his exploration was going to be entirely unsuccessful In fact although the fence continued as far as the eye could see the huts and buildings and smoke stacks were disappearing in the distance behind him and the fence seemed to be separating him from nothing but open space.

Shmuel thought about it and looked down at his fingers and they wiggled in the air as if he was trying to calculate 'I'm nine ' he said 'My birthday is April the fifteenth nineteen thirty-four Bruno stared at him in surprise 'What did you say ' he asked 'I said my birthday is April the fifteenth nineteen thirty-four.'

'The Fury has something he wants to discuss with me ' said Father who was allowed to interrupt Mother even if no one else was I just got a phone call this afternoon The only time he can make it is Thursday evening and he's invited himself to dinner Mother's eyes opened wide and her mouth  made the shape of an O Bruno stared at her and wondered whether this was what he looked like when he was surprised about something.

An hour before the Fury was due to arrive Gretel and Bruno were brought downstairs where they received a rare invitation into Father's office Gretel was wearing a white dress and knee socks and her hair had been twisted into corkscrew curls Bruno was wearing a pair of dark brown shorts a plain white shirt and a dark brown tie He had a new pair of shoes for the occasion and was very proud of them even though they were too small for him and were pinching his feet and making it difficult for him to walk All these preparations and fine clothes seemed a little extravagant all the same because Bruno and Gretel weren't even invited to dinner they had eaten an hour earlier.

The woman standing beside him however was quite the most beautiful woman he had ever seen in his life She had blonde hair and very red lips and while the Fury spoke to Mother she turned and looked at Bruno and smiled making him go red with embarrassment.

The matter was resolved quickly however as the Fury who was the rudest guest Bruno had ever witnessed turned round and walked directly into the dining room and promptly sat down at the head of the table—in Father's seat —without another word A little flustered Mother and Father followed him inside and Mother gave instructions to Lars that he could start heating up the soup.

Bruno watched him hoping he was feeling all right although he managed to release the cork without any accidents But after he had filled Father's glass and turned to refill Lieutenant Kotler's he lost his grip of the bottle somehow and it fell crashing glug-glug-glugging its contents out directly onto the young man's lap What happened then was both unexpected and extremely unpleasant Lieutenant Kotler grew very angry with Pavel and no one—not Bruno not Gretel not Mother and not even Father—stepped in to stop him doing what he did next even though none of them could watch Even though it  made Bruno cry and Gretel grow pale.

'I'm reading ' said Bruno 'What are you reading ' she asked him and rather than answer he simply turned the cover towards her so she could see for herself She  made a raspberry sound through her lips and some of her spit landed on Bruno's face 'Boring ' she said in a sing-song voice 'It's not boring at all ' said Bruno 'It's an adventure It's better than dolls that's for sure Gretel didn't rise to the bait on that one 'What are you doing ' she repeated irritating Bruno even further I told you I'm trying to read ' he said in a grumpy voice 'If some people would just let me.'

For several weeks the rain was on and off and on and off and Bruno and Shmuel did not see as much of each other as they would have liked When they did meet Bruno found that he was starting to worry about his friend because he seemed to be getting even thinner by the day and his face was growing more and more grey.

Seething with anger Bruno went into the kitchen and got the biggest surprise of his life There sitting at the table a long way from the other side of the fence was Shmuel Bruno could barely believe his eyes.

Shmuel looked as if he wasn't really listening instead his eyes were focused on the slices of chicken and stuffing that Bruno was throwing casually into his mouth After a moment Bruno realized what he was looking at and immediately felt guilty I'm sorry Shmuel ' he said quickly 'I should have given you some chicken too Are you hungry	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O	sadness
'No if he comes back—' said Shmuel shaking his head quickly and looking back and forth towards the door 'If who comes back You don't mean Lieutenant Kotler ' 'I'm just supposed to be cleaning the glasses ' he said looking at the bowl of water in front of him in despair and then looking back at the slices of chicken that Bruno held out to him.

'He's not going to mind ' said Bruno who was confused by how anxious Shmuel seemed 'It's only food 'I can't ' said Shmuel shaking his head and looking as if he was going to cry 'He'll come back I know he will ' he continued his sentences running quickly together 'I should have eaten them when you offered them now it's too late if I take them he'll come in and—'	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O	sadness
'Shmuel Here ' said Bruno stepping forward and putting the slices in his friend's hand 'Just eat them There's lots left for our tea—you don't have to worry about that The boy stared at the food in his hand for a moment and then looked up at Bruno with wide and grateful but terrified eyes He threw one more glance in the direction of the door and then seemed to make a decision because he thrust all three slices into his mouth in one go and gobbled them down in twenty seconds flat.

'You have been eating ' insisted Lieutenant Kotler 'Did you steal something from that fridge ' Shmuel opened his mouth and closed it He opened it again and tried to find words but there were none He looked towards Bruno his eyes pleading for help 'Answer me ' shouted Lieutenant Kotler 'Did you steal something from that fridge	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O O O O O O O O O	anger
Bruno hadn't seen his grandmother since leaving Berlin but he had thought about her every day The things he remembered most about her were the productions that she and he and Gretel performed at Christmas and birthdays and how she always had the perfect costume to suit whatever role he played When he thought that they would never be able to do that again it  made him very sad indeed.

The two days they spent in Berlin were also very sad ones There was the funeral and Bruno and Gretel and Father and Mother and Grandfather sat in the front row Father wearing his most impressive uniform the starched and pressed one with the decorations Father was particularly sad Mother told Bruno because he had fought with Grandmother and they hadn't  made it up before she died.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O	sadness
There were a lot of wreaths delivered to the church and Father was proud of the fact that one of them had been sent by the Fury but when Mother heard she said that Grandmother would turn in her grave if she knew it was there.

There was also the fact that Lieutenant Kotler had been transferred away from Out-With and wasn't around to make Bruno feel angry and upset all the time (His departure had come about very suddenly and there had been a lot of shouting between Father and Mother about it late at night but he was gone that was for sure and he wasn't coming back Gretel was inconsolable That was something else to be happy about: no one called him 'little man' any more.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness
He enjoyed walking along the fence every afternoon and was pleased to see that his friend seemed a lot happier these days and his eyes didn't seem so sunken although his body was still ridiculously skinny and his face unpleasantly grey.

'No ' said Bruno 'I don't understand why we're not allowed on the other side of it What's so wrong with us that we can't go over there and play ' Gretel stared at him and then suddenly started laughing only stopping when she saw that Bruno was being perfectly serious.

'We're the opposite ' said Gretel answering quickly and sounding a lot more satisfied with this answer 'Yes that's it We're the opposite 'All right ' said Bruno pleased that he had it settled in his head at last 'And the Opposite live on this side of the fence and the Jews live on that.'

It turned out that both Gretel and Bruno had lice in their hair and Gretel had to be treated with a special shampoo that smelled horrible and afterwards she sat in her room for hours on end crying her eyes out.

Bruno had the shampoo as well but then Father decided that the best thing was for him to start afresh and he got a razor and shaved all Bruno's hair off which  made Bruno cry It didn't take long and he hated seeing all his hair float down from his head and land on the floor at his feet but Father said it had to be done.

When he saw his friend the next day Shmuel started to laugh at Bruno's appearance which didn't do a lot for his dwindling self-confidence 'I look just like you now ' said Bruno sadly as if this was a terrible thing to admit.

Over the course of the next few weeks Mother seemed increasingly unhappy with life at Out-With and Bruno understood perfectly well why that might be After all when they'd first arrived he had hated it due to the fact that it was nothing like home and lacked such things as three best friends for life But that had changed for him over time mostly due to Shmuel who had become more important to him than Karl or Daniel or Martin had ever been But Mother didn't have a Shmuel of her own There was no one for her to talk to and the only person who she had been remotely friendly with—the young Lieutenant Kotler—had been transferred somewhere else.

But on the other hand he'd grown used to life at Out-With: he didn't mind Herr Liszt he'd become much friendlier with Maria than he ever had been back in Berlin Gretel was still going through a phase and keeping out of his way (and she didn't seem to be quite so much of a Hopeless Case any more) and his afternoon conversations with Shmuel filled him with happiness.

Nothing at all changed for a few weeks life went on as normal Father spent most of his time either in his office or on the other side of the fence Mother kept very quiet during the day and was having an awful lot more of her afternoon naps some of them not even in the afternoon but before lunch and Bruno was worried for her health because he'd never known anyone need quite so many medicinal sherries Gretel stayed in her room concentrating on the various maps she had pasted on the walls and consulting the newspapers for hours at a time before moving the pins around a little (Herr Liszt was particularly pleased with her for doing this.)

And Bruno did exactly what was asked of him and caused no chaos at all and enjoyed the fact that he had one secret friend whom no one knew about Then one day Father summoned Bruno and Gretel into his office and informed them of the changes that were to come.

But Maggie had no eloquence in reply--she could not make up fine sentences it embarrassed her dreadfully to tell him even that she loved him and when he was sentimental it was her habit to turn it off with a joke if she could She wanted terribly to ask him sometimes what he had meant when he said that he didn't love her as he had loved other women.

Young Cowperwood's mind was working He had no money with him but his father was teller of the Third National Bank and he could quote him as reference He could sell all of his soap to the family grocer surely or if not to other grocers Other people were anxious to get this soap at this price Why not he	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O	disgust
He was to look at a phlegmatic type of man--short stout wrinkled about the eyes rather protuberant as to stomach red-necked red-faced the least bit popeyed but shrewd kindly good-natured and witty He had because of his naturally common-sense ideas and rather pleasing disposition built up a sound and successful business here He was getting strong in years and would gladly have welcomed the hearty cooperation of his son if the latter had been entirely suited to the business.

The Watermans Henry and George were greatly pleased with the way he handled their accounts There was a sense of security in his very presence He soon began to call Brother George's attention to the condition of certain accounts making suggestions as to their possible liquidation or discontinuance which pleased that individual greatly He saw a way of lightening his own labors through the intelligence of this youth while at the same time developing a sense of pleasant companionship with him.

The occasion of the meeting was an evening call on the part of the Semples Mr Semple being desirous of talking with Henry Cowperwood concerning a new transportation feature which was then entering the world--namely street-cars A tentative line incorporated by the North Pennsylvania Railway Company had been put into operation on a mile and a half of tracks extending from Willow Street along Front to Germantown Road and thence by various streets to what was then known as the Cohocksink Depot and it was thought that in time this mode of locomotion might drive out the hundreds of omnibuses which now crowded and made impassable the downtown streets Young Cowperwood had been greatly interested from the start Railway transportation as a whole interested him anyway but this particular phase was most fascinating.

There was great talk concerning morality much praise of virtue and decency and much lifting of hands in righteous horror at people who broke or were even rumored to have broken the Seventh Commandment He did not take this talk seriously Already he had broken it secretly many times Other young men did Yet again he was a little sick of the women of the streets and the bagnio There were too many coarse evil features in connection with such contacts.

At first when Frank called she did not have much to say She was gracious but the burden of conversation fell on her husband Cowperwood watched the varying expression of her face from time to time and if she had been at all psychic she must have felt something Fortunately she was not Semple talked to him pleasantly because in the first place Frank was becoming financially significant was suave and ingratiating and in the next place he was anxious to get richer and somehow Frank represented progress to him in that line One spring evening they sat on the porch and talked--nothing very important--slavery street-cars the panic--it was on then that of 1857--the development of the West.

Thereafter for a year or so Cowperwood bought his shoes of Mr Semple Occasionally also he stopped in the Chestnut Street store to exchange the time of the day Semple asked his opinion as to the advisability of buying some shares in the Fifth and Sixth Street line which having secured a franchise was creating great excitement Cowperwood gave him his best judgment It was sure to be profitable He himself had purchased one hundred shares at five dollars a share and urged Semple to do so But he was not interested in him personally He liked Mrs Semple though he did not see her very often.

He could not think of her reasonably and he did not talk of her much to any one His family knew that he went to see her but there had grown up in the Cowperwood family a deep respect for the mental force of Frank He was genial cheerful gay at most times without being talkative and he was decidedly successful Everybody knew he was making money now His salary was fifty dollars a week and he was certain soon to get more.

In spite of her fears and her uncertainty Lillian Semple accepted his attentions and interest because equally in spite of herself she was drawn to him One night when she was going to bed she stopped in front of her dressing table and looked at her face and her bare neck and arms They were very pretty A subtle something came over her as she surveyed her long peculiarly shaded hair She thought of young Cowperwood and then was chilled and shamed by the vision of the late Mr Semple and the force and quality of public opinion.

Cowperwood had implicit faith in the future of the street railway In support of this belief he risked all he could spare on new issues of stock shares in new companies He wanted to be on the inside wherever possible always though this was a little difficult in the matter of the street-railways he having been so young when they started and not having yet arranged his financial connections to make them count for much.

The home atmosphere which they established when they returned from their honeymoon was a great improvement in taste over that which had characterized the earlier life of Mrs Cowperwood as Mrs Semple They had decided to occupy her house on North Front Street for a while at least.

Those who recall the early years of their married life can best realize the subtle changes which this new condition brought to Frank for like all who accept the hymeneal yoke he was influenced to a certain extent by the things with which he surrounded himself Primarily from certain traits of his character one would have imagined him called to be a citizen of eminent respectability and worth He appeared to be an ideal home man He delighted to return to his wife in the evenings leaving the crowded downtown section where traffic clamored and men hurried Here he could feel that he was well-stationed and physically happy in life The thought of the dinner-table with candles upon it (his idea) the thought of Lillian in a trailing gown of pale-blue or green silk--he liked her in those colors the thought of a large fireplace flaming with solid lengths of cord-wood and Lillian snuggling in his arms gripped his immature imagination As has been said before he cared nothing for books but life pictures trees physical contact--these in spite of his shrewd and already gripping financial calculations held him To live richly joyously fully--his whole nature craved that.

And Mrs Cowperwood in spite of the difference in their years appeared to be a fit mate for him at this time She was once awakened and for the time being clinging responsive dreamy His mood and hers was for a baby and in a little while that happy expectation was whispered to him by her She had half fancied that her previous barrenness was due to herself and was rather surprised and delighted at the proof that it was not so It opened new possibilities--a seemingly glorious future of which she was not afraid He liked it the idea of self-duplication.

There was so much to think of in this connection--the spermatozoic beginning the strange period of gestation in women the danger of disease and delivery He had gone through a real period of strain when Frank Jr was born for Mrs Cowperwood was frightened He feared for the beauty of her body--troubled over the danger of losing her and he actually endured his first worry when he stood outside the door the day the child came Not much--he was too self-sufficient too resourceful and yet he worried conjuring up thoughts of death and the end of their present state.

These two felt unutterably bound to each other Cowperwood once he came to understand her fancied that he had found the one person with whom he could live happily the rest of his life She was so young so confident so hopeful so undismayed All these months since they had first begun to reach out to each other he had been hourly contrasting her with his wife.

As it was he was constantly watching the certificates of loan issue for the city treasury --buying large quantities when the market was falling to protect it and selling heavily though cautiously when he saw it rising and to do this he had to have a great deal of free money to permit him to do it He was constantly fearful of some break in the market which would affect the value of all his securities and result in the calling of his loans There was no storm in sight He did not see that anything could happen in reason but he did not want to spread himself out too thin.

"His one pet idea the thing he put more faith in than anything else was his street-railway manipulations and particularly his actual control of the Seventeenth and Nineteenth Street line Through an advance to him on deposit made in his bank by Stener at a time when the stock of the Seventeenth and Nineteenth Street line was at a low ebb he had managed to pick up fifty-one per cent of the stock for himself and Stener by virtue of which he was able to do as he pleased with the road To accomplish this however he had resorted to some very ""peculiar"" methods as they afterward came to be termed in financial circles to get this stock at his own valuation Through agents he caused suits for damages to be brought against the company for non-payment of interest due A little stock in the hands of a hireling a request made to a court of record to examine the books of the company in order to determine whether a receivership were not advisable a simultaneous attack in the stock market selling at three five seven and ten points off brought the frightened stockholders into the market with their holdings The banks considered the line a poor risk and called their loans in connection with it."

This intoxicated him for immediately he saw the opportunity of fulfilling his long-contemplated dream--that of reorganizing the company in conjunction with the North Pennsylvania line issuing three shares where one had been before and after unloading all but a control on the general public using the money secured to buy into other lines which were to be boomed and sold in the same way In short he was one of those early daring manipulators who later were to seize upon other and ever larger phases of American natural development for their own aggrandizement.

However by the spring and summer of 1871 Cowperwood had actually without being in any conceivable danger from any source spread himself out very thin Because of his great success he had grown more liberal--easier--in his financial ventures By degrees and largely because of his own confidence in himself he had induced his father to enter upon his street-car speculations to use the resources of the Third National to carry a part of his loans and to furnish capital at such times as quick resources were necessary In the beginning the old gentleman had been a little nervous and skeptical but as time had worn on and nothing but profit eventuated he grew bolder and more confident.

Then after several years of this secret relationship in which the ties of sympathy and understanding grew stronger instead of weaker came the storm It burst unexpectedly and out of a clear sky and bore no relation to the intention or volition of any individual It was nothing more than a fire a distant one--the great Chicago fire October 7th 1871 which burned that city-- its vast commercial section--to the ground and instantly and incidentally produced a financial panic vicious though of short duration in various other cities in America.

Cowperwood Sr was already plucking at his side-whiskers in a confused and troubled way He was cogitating as to what might happen to him in case his son failed for he was deeply involved with him He was a little gray in his complexion now frightened for he had already strained many points in his affairs to accommodate his son If Frank should not be able promptly on the morrow to meet the call which the bank might have to make for one hundred and fifty thousand dollars the onus and scandal of the situation would be on him.

Owen was running swiftly in his mind over Cowperwood's affairs--as much as he knew of them He felt keenly that the banker ought to be shaken out This dilemma was his fault not Stener's--he felt It was strange to him that his father did not see it and resent it.

He was of a domestic turn of mind Still Sunday evening being an excellent one for conference purposes generally in the world of politics he was not without the thought that some one or other of his distinguished confreres might call and when the combination footman and butler announced the presence of Butler and his son he was well pleased.

He hurried down the street to various bankers and brokers suggesting that they do this--close the exchange At a few minutes before twelve o'clock he drove rapidly to the station to meet Stener but to his great disappointment the latter did not arrive It looked as though he had missed his train Cowperwood sensed something some trick and decided to go to the city hall and also to Stener's house Perhaps he had returned and was trying to avoid him.

Stener as he saw him now was a pawn in whosoever's hands he happened to be at the time and despite Mr Mollenhauer and Mr Simpson and Mr Butler he proposed to attempt to keep him in his own hands if possible And so he stood there looking at him as might a snake at a bird determined to galvanize him into selfish self-interest if possible But Stener was so frightened that at the moment it looked as though there was little to be done with him His face was a grayish-blue: his eyelids and eye rings puffy and his hands and lips moist God what a hole he was in now	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear

Stener stood there ridiculously meditating when as a matter of fact his very financial blood was oozing away Yet he was afraid to act He was afraid of Mollenhauer afraid of Cowperwood afraid of life and of himself The thought of panic loss was not so much a definite thing connected with his own property his money as it was with his social and political standing in the community.

That was why he had been so ready to let Cowperwood act for him and now when he should have seen more clearly than ever the significance of what Cowperwood was proposing he was frightened and his reason obscured by such things as Mollenhauer's probable opposition and rage Cowperwood's possible failure his own inability to face a real crisis Cowperwood's innate financial ability did not reassure Stener in this hour.

Stener was just about to make another weak rejoinder when the door from the outer office opened and Albert Stires Stener's chief clerk entered Stener was too flustered to really pay any attention to Stires for the moment but Cowperwood took matters in his own hands.

Not seeing what had happened to his iron or knowing that we were fast the other harpooner promptly hurled his second iron which struck solidly It was a very pretty tangle but our position was rather bad The whale between us was tearing the bowels of the deep up in his rage and fear we were struggling frantically to get our sail down and at any moment that wretched iron through our upper strake might tear a plank out of us.

Our chief foaming at the mouth with rage and excitement was screeching inarticulate blasphemy at the other mate who not knowing what was the matter was yelling back all his copious vocabulary of abuse I felt very glad the whale was between us or there would surely have been murder done At last out drops the iron leaving a jagged hole you could put your arm through Wasn't Mr Count mad	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness

Consequently the state of the ship was filthy nor could all our efforts keep her clean This farmyard condition of things was permitted to continue for about a week when the officers got so tired of it and the captain so annoyed at the frequent loss of fowls by their flying overboard that the edict went forth to feed the foremast hands on poultry till further orders.

Two and a half hours of energetic work was required of us before we got on terms with the fleeing monsters but at last to our great joy they broke water from sounding right among us It was a considerable surprise but we were all ready and before they had spouted twice three boats were fast only myself keeping out in accordance with my instructions.

Thenceforward for another hour in spite of all our efforts we could not get within striking distance mainly because of the close attention of the cow which stuck to her lord like a calf to its mother I was getting so impatient of this hindrance that it was all I could do to restrain myself from lancing the cow though I felt convinced that if I did I should spoil a good job.

We took them on board and the boat returned again By the time the slack came we had about four hundred and fifty fathoms out--a goodly heap to pile up loose in our stern-sheets I felt sure however that we should have but little more trouble with our fish in fact I was half afraid that he would die before getting to the surface in which case he might sink and be lost We hauled steadily away the line not coming in very easily until I judged there was only about another hundred fathoms out.

so when I confess that I felt more than a little scared at this sudden change in the tactics of my opponent I hope I shall be excusedRemembering however that all our lives depended on keeping cool I told myself that even if I was frightened I must not go all to pieces but compel myself to think and act calmly since I was responsible for others If the animal had not been in so blind a fury I am afraid my task would have been much harder but he was mad and his savage rushes were though disquieting unsystematic and clumsy.

Samuela and Polly set to work with their sheath-knives and soon excavated a space in the blubber to enable them to reach the meat Then they cut off some good-sized junks and divided it up It was not half bad and as we chewed on the tough black fibre I could hardly help smiling as I thought how queer a Christmas dinner we were having But eating soon heightened our thirst and our real sufferings then began.

The captain shook hands with me cordially pooh-poohing the loss of the boat as an unavoidable incident of the trade but expressing his heart-felt delight at getting us all back safe The whale we had killed was ample compensation for the loss of several boats though such was the vigour with which the sharks were going for him that it was deemed advisable to cut in at once working all night.

I have no doubt whatever that some of the gentry who swear at large about the evils of missionaries would have been loud in their disgust at the entire absence of drink and debauchery and the prevalence of what they would doubtless characterize as adjective hypocrisy on the part of the natives but no decent man could help rejoicing at the peace the security and friendliness manifested on every hand nor help awarding unstinted praise to whoever had been the means of bringing about so desirable a state of things.

That being settled we anchored the boat and lit pipes preparatory to passing as comfortable a night as might be under the circumstances the only thing troubling me being the anxiety of the skipper on our behalf Presently the blackness beneath was lit up by a wide band of phosphoric light shed in the wake of no ordinary-sized fish probably an immense shark.

Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it and found in it a very small cake on which the words `EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants`Well I'll eat it ' said Alice `and if it makes me grow larger I can reach the key and if it makes me grow smaller I can creep under the door so either way I'll get into the garden and I don't care which happens ' She ate a little bit and said anxiously to herself `Which way Which way holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size: to be sure this generally happens when one eats cake but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way she set to work and very soon finished off the cake.

'Hello Bruno ' he said when he saw his friend approaching 'Hello Shmuel ' said Bruno 'I wasn't sure if we'd ever see each other again—with the rain and everything I mean ' said Shmuel 'I thought you might be kept indoors 'It was touch and go for a while ' said Bruno 'What with the weather being so bad Shmuel nodded and held out his hands to Bruno who opened his mouth in delight.

Bruno thought about it He had promised his friend that and he wasn't the sort to go back on a promise especially when it was the last time they were going to see each other 'All right ' he said although he felt a lot less confident now than he had before 'But where should we look ' 'You said we'd need to find evidence ' said Shmuel who was feeling upset because he thought that if Bruno didn't help him then who would	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O	sadness

But just as he said this his feet brought him up a set of steps and as he marched on he found there was no more rain coming down any more because they were all piling into a long room that was surprisingly warm and must have been very securely built because no rain was getting in anywhere In fact it felt completely airtight 'Well that's something ' he said glad to be out of the storm for a few minutes at least 'I expect we'll have to wait here till it eases off and then I'll get to go home.'

Patrick's face cleared It was no grace or beauty that he feared in any stranger but the sheer might and unright that their Regency enabled the House of Albany to exercise over the orphans of the royal family whose head was absent and a captive knight could be no mischievous person Still this might be only a specious pretence to impose on the chaplain and gain admittance to the castle and Patrick was resolved to be well on his guard though he replied courteously to the graceful bow with which the stranger greeted him saying in a manly mellow voice and southern accent 'I have been bold enough to presume on the good father's offer of hospitality Sir.'

They were in effect riding somewhat carelessly and with the ease of men whose feat was performed and who expected no more opposition Full in the midst was Lilias entirely muffled and pinioned by a large plaid drawn closely round her and held upon the front of the saddle of a large tall horse ridden by a slender light-limbed wiry groom whom Malcolm knew as Christopher Hall a retainer of the Duke of Albany and beside him rode her captor Sir Walter Stewart a man little above twenty but with a bronzed hardened reckless expression that made him look much older and of huge height and giant buildMalcolm knew him well and regarded him with unmitigated horror and dread both from the knowledge of his ruffianly violence even towards his father from fear of his intentions and from the misery that his brutal jests scoffs and practical jokes had often personally inflicted:  and the sight of his sister in the power of this wicked man was the realization of all his worst fears But ere there was time for more than one strong pang of consternation and constitutional terror Sir James's shout of 'StAndrew for the right ' was ringing out echoed by all the fifteen in ambush with him as simultaneously they leapt forward	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear

'Kinsman ' thought Malcolm 'do all wandering Stewarts claim kin to the blood royal ' but then as he looked at Sir James's stately head he felt that no assumption could be unbecoming in one of such a presence and so kind to himself and ashamed of the moment's petulance dismounted and as John said 'This is the way to our noon meat ' he let himself be conducted through the trees to a glade sheltered from the wind where a Lenten though not unsavoury meal of bread dried fish and eggs was laid out on the grass in a bright warm sunshine and Hal declaring himself to have a hunter's appetite and that he knew Jamie had been starved in Scotland and was as lean as a greyhound seated himself on the grass and to Malcolm's extreme surprise not to say disgust was served by Lord Marmion on the knee and with doffed cap.

He was glad that his own Sir James was equal in dignity as well as superior in height and he thought the terrible red lightning of those auburn eyes would be impossible to the sparkling azure eyes of the Englishman steadfast keen and brilliant unspeakably though they were but so soon as Sir James seemed to have made his explanation the look was most winningly turned on him a hand held out and he was thus greeted:  'Welcome my young Prince Malcolm I am happy that your cousin thinks so well of our cheer that he has brought you to partake it.'

A courier rode up at the moment and presented some letters which Sir Harry at once opened and read beckoning his brother and Sir James to his side while Malcolm rode on in their wake in a state of dismay and bewilderment Nigel and Lord Marmion were together at so great an interval that he could not fall back on them nor learn from them who these brothers were And there was something in the ironical suppressed pity with which Harry had spoken of his prospects with the King of Scots that terrified him all the more because he knew that Sir James and Nigel would both hold it unworthy of him to have spoken freely of his own sovereign with an Englishman Would James be another Walter and if so would Sir James Stewart protect him He had acquired much affection for and strong reliance on the knight but there was something unexplained and his hear sank.

Yet he was reluctant to break with the old habits that had hitherto been part of his nature he felt after every word of Esclairmonde--nay after every glance towards her--as though it were a blessed thing to have like her chosen the better part he knew she would approve his resort to the home of piety and learning he was aware that when with Ralf Percy and the other youths of the Court he was ashamed of his own scrupulousness and tempted to neglect observances that they might call monkish and unmanly and he was not at all sure that in face of the enemy a panic might not seize him and disgrace him for ever In effect he did not know what he wished even when he found that the Queen had decided against going across the sea and that therefore all the ladies would remain with her at Shene or Windsor.

He had shot up suddenly to a fair height had almost lost his lameness and gained much more appearance of health and power of enduring fatigue His nerves had become less painfully sensitive and when after his first skirmish during which he had kept close to King James far too much terrified to stir an inch from him he had not only found himself perfectly safe but had been much praised for his valour he had been so much pleased with himself that he quite wished for another occasion of displaying his bravery and what with use and what with the increasing spirit of pugnacity he was as sincere as Ralf Percy in abusing the French for never coming to a pitched battle Perhaps indeed Malcolm spoke even more eagerly than Ralf in his own surprise and gratification at finding himself no coward and his fear lest Percy should detect that he ever had been supposed to be such.

To this the deputies consented and the next day was fixed for the surrender The difficulty was as Henry had found at Harfleur Rouen and many other places to enforce forbearance on his soldiery who regarded plunder as their lawful prey the enemy as their natural game and the trouble a city had given them as a cause for unmercifulness The more time changed his army from the feudal gathering of English country gentlemen and yeomen to mercenary bands of men-at-arms the mere greedy rapacious and insubordinate became their temper Well knowing the greatness of the peril and that the very best of his captains had scarcely the will if they had the power to restrain the license that soon became barbarity unimaginable he spoke sadly overnight of his dread of the day of surrender when it might prove impossible to prevent deeds that would be not merely a blot on his scutcheon but a shame to human nature looking back to the exultation with which he had entered Harfleur as a mere effect of boyish ignorance and thoughtlessness.

James feared he had been mistaken and looked to the influence of Esclairmonde to repair the evil if perchance she should follow the Queen to France And this it was almost certain she must do since she was entirely dependent upon the Countess of Hainault and could not obtain admission to a nunnery without recovering a portion of her estates.

Would she be there That was the chief anxiety:  for it was not certain that either she or her mistress would risk themselves on the Continent and Catherine had given no intimation as to who would be in her suite--so that as Henry had merrily observed he was the only one in the whole party who was not in suspense except indeed Salisbury who had sent his commands to his little daughter to come out with the Queen.

James smiled and coloured with pleasure the fantastic message was not devoid of reality in the days when young imaginative spirits tried to hide the prose of war and policy in a bright mist of romantic fancy nor was he ashamed to bend his manly head in reverence to and even press to his lips his lady's first love- letter in the very sight of the satirical though sympathizing Bedford of whom he eagerly asked of the fair Joan's health and welfare and whether she were flouted by Queen Catherine.

The idea is of the supposed course of a thoughtful refined conscientious man through the earlier times of the Reformation glad of the hope of cleansing the Church but hoping to cleanse not to break away from her--a hope that Luther himself long cherished and which was not entirely frustrated till the re-assembly at Trent in the next generation Justice has never been done to the men who feared to loose their hold on the Church Catholic as the one body to which the promises were made Their loyalty has been treated as blindness timidity or superstition but that there were many such persons and those among the very highest minds of their time no one can have any doubt after reading such lives as those of Friedrich the Wise of Saxony of Erasmus of Vittoria Colonna or of Cardinal Giustiniani.

The words were in the most boorish dialect and pronunciation the stranger to Christina's ears because intercourse with foreign merchants and a growing affectation of Latinism had much refined the city language to which she was accustomed and she was surprised to perceive by her father's gesture and address that the speaker must be one of the lords of the castle She looked up and saw on the pathway above her a tall large-framed young man his skin dyed red with sun and wind in odd contrast with his pale shaggy hair moustache and beard as though the weather had tanned the one and bleached the other.

Manfred's impatience for this ceremonial was remarked by his family  and neighbours The former indeed apprehending the severity of  their Prince's disposition did not dare to utter their surmises on  this precipitation Hippolita his wife an amiable lady did  sometimes venture to represent the danger of marrying their only son  so early considering his great youth and greater infirmities but  she never received any other answer than reflections on her own  sterility who had given him but one heir.

The spectators who as little comprehended the cause of the Prince's  fury as all the rest they had seen were at a loss to unravel this new  circumstance The young peasant himself was stillmore astonished not conceiving how he had offended the Prince Yet recollecting  himself with a mixture of grace and humility he disengaged himself  from Manfred's grip and then with an obeisance which discovered more  jealousy of innocence than dismay he asked with respect of what he  was guilty Manfred more enraged at the vigour however decently  exerted with which the young man had shaken off his hold than  appeased by his submission ordered his attendants to seize him and if he had not been withheld by his friends whom he had invited to the  nuptials would have poignarded the peasant in their arms.

How cutting was the anguish which the good man felt when he perceived  this turn in the wily Prince He trembled for Hippolita whose ruin  he saw was determined and he feared if Manfred had no hope of  recovering Isabella that his impatience for a son would direct him to  some other object who might not be equally proof against the  temptation of Manfred's rank For some time the holy man remained  absorbed in thought At length conceiving some hopes from delay he  thought the wisest conduct would be to prevent the Prince from  despairing of recovering Isabella	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear

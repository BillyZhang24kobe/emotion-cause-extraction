Then Thorkill seeing that they were of two minds dispelled their hesitation to enter by manful encouragement counselling them to restrain themselves and not to touch any piece of gear in the house they were about to enter albeit it seemed delightful to have or pleasant to behold to keep their hearts as far from all covetousness as from fear neither to desire what was pleasant to take nor dread what was awful to look upon though they should find themselves amidst abundance of both these things.

Thus SIWARD by the sovereign vote of the whole Danish assembly received the empire of his father But after the defeats he had inflicted everywhere he was satisfied with the honour he received at home and liked better to be famous with the gown than with the sword.

Straightway he sought medicine for his grief in loneliness and patiently confined the grief of his sick soul within the walls of his house But this bitter sorrow was driven out of him by the sudden arrival of Iwar who had been expelled from the kingdom For the Gauls had made him fly and had wrongfully bestowed royal power on a certain Ella the son of Hame.

Then to prevent any more troublesome business delaying his hopes of marriage he went back to Gewar and enjoyed the coveted embraces of Nanna Next having treated Helgi and Thora very generously he brought his new queen back to Sweden being as much honoured by all for his victory as Balder was laughed at for his flight.

So he besought them to make his son RORIK king so that the judgment of wicked men should not transfer the royalty to strange and unknown houses averring that he would reap more joy from the succession of his son than bitterness from his own impending death This request was speedily granted.

"Drawing him by those appeals and warily noting the right spot to plant his blow he turned the other edge of his sword to the front fearing that the thin side of his blade was too frail for his strength and smote with a piercing stroke through the prince's body When Wermund heard it he said that the sound of his sword ""Skrep"" had reached his ear for the second time."

He had several times taken caravans to Karague and knew all the languages well but unfortunately he afterwards proved to be what his name implied That however I could not foresee so trusting to him and good-luck I commenced making fresh enlistments of porters but they came and went in the most tantalising manner notwithstanding I offered three times the hire that any merchant could afford to give.

This night one was shot without any mistake about it for the next morning we tracked him by his blood and afterwards heard he had died of his wound The Wasui elders contrary to my expectation then came and congratulated us on our success They thought us most wonderful men and possessed of supernatural powers for the thief in question was a magician who until now was thought to be invulnerable Indeed they said Arabs with enormous caravans had often been plundered by these people but though they had so many more guns than ourselves they never succeeded in killing one.

At his invitation we now crossed over the spur to the Ingezi Kagera side when to surprise me the canoes I had come up the lake in appeared before us They had gone out of the lake at its northern end paddled into and then up the Kagera to where we stood showing by actual navigation the connection of these highland lakes with the rivers which drain the various spurs of the Mountains of the Moon.

A man from Ruanda then told us of the Wilyanwantu (men-eaters) who disdained all food but human flesh and Rumanika confirmed the statement Though I felt very sceptical  about it I could not help thinking it a curious coincidence that the position they were said to occupy agreed with Petherick's Nyam Nyams (men-eaters).

No one knew of a lake to supply the waters nor where they came from That they flowed into the lake there was no doubt--as I could see by the trickling waters in some few places--and they lay exactly on the equator Rising out of the valley I found all the country just as hilly as before but many of the rush-drains going to northward and in the dells were such magnificent trees they quite took me by surprise Clean-trunked they towered up just as so many great pillars and then spread out their high branches like a canopy over us I thought of the blue gums of Australia and believed these would beat them.

"This double failure was a more serious affair then a mere slight for my cows were eaten up and my men clamouring incessantly for food and though they might by orders help themselves ""ku n'yangania""--by seizing--from the Waganda it hurt my feelings so much to witness this that I tried from the first to dispense with it telling the king I had always flogged my men for stealing and now he turned them into a pack of thieves."

About a year later Mr Semple died It was an untimely death one of those fortuitous and in a way insignificant episodes which are nevertheless dramatic in a dull way to those most concerned He was seized with a cold in the chest late in the fall--one of those seizures ordinarily attributed to wet feet or to going out on a damp day without an overcoat--and had insisted on going to business when Mrs Semple urged him to stay at home and recuperate He was in his way a very determined person not obstreperously so but quietly and under the surface Business was a great urge He saw himself soon to be worth about fifty thousand dollars Then this cold--nine more days of pneumonia--and he was dead The shoe store was closed for a few days the house was full of sympathetic friends and church people There was a funeral with burial service in the Callowhill Presbyterian Church to which they belonged and then he was buried Mrs Semple cried bitterly The shock of death affected her greatly and left her for a time in a depressed state A brother of hers David Wiggin undertook for the time being to run the shoe business for her There was no will but in the final adjustment which included the sale of the shoe business there being no desire on anybody's part to contest her right to all the property she received over eighteen thousand dollars She continued to reside in the Front Street house and was considered a charming and interesting widow.

It was while he was calling on her in this way that his Uncle Seneca died in Cuba and left him fifteen thousand dollars This money made him worth nearly twenty-five thousand dollars in his own right and he knew exactly what to do with it A panic had come since Mr Semple had died which had illustrated to him very clearly what an uncertain thing the brokerage business was There was really a severe business depression.

Either the well was very deep or she fell very slowly for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen nextFirst she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to but it was too dark to see anything then she looked at the sides of the well and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegsShe took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed it was labelled `ORANGE MARMALADE' but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it `Well ' thought Alice to herself `after such a fall as this I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs How brave they'll all think me at home Why I wouldn't say anything about it even if I fell off the top of the house	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise
And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely gardenFirst however she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this `for it might end you know ' said Alice to herself `in my going out altogether like a candleI wonder what I should be like then ' And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O B-EMO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear
Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it and found in it a very small cake on which the words `EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants`Well I'll eat it ' said Alice `and if it makes me grow larger I can reach the key and if it makes me grow smaller I can creep under the door so either way I'll get into the garden and I don't care which happens ' She ate a little bit and said anxiously to herself `Which way Which way holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size: to be sure this generally happens when one eats cake but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way she set to work and very soon finished off the cake.

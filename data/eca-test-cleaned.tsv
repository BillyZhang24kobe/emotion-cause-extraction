"Her love of dirt gave way to an inclination for finery and she grew clean as she grew smart she had now the pleasure of sometimes hearing her father and mother remark on her personal improvement ""Catherine grows quite a good-looking girl -- she is almost pretty today "" were words which caught her ears now and then and how welcome were the sounds To look almost pretty is an acquisition of higher delight to a girl who has been looking plain the first fifteen years of her life than a beauty from her cradle can ever receive."

Mr Allen who owned the chief of the property about Fullerton the village in Wiltshire where the Morlands lived was ordered to Bath for the benefit of a gouty constitution -- and his lady a good-humoured woman fond of Miss Morland and probably aware that if adventures will not befall a young lady in her own village she must seek them abroad invited her to go with them Mr and Mrs Morland were all compliance and Catherine all happiness.

When the hour of departure drew near the maternal anxiety of Mrs Morland will be naturally supposed to be most severe A thousand alarming presentiments of evil to her beloved Catherine from this terrific separation must oppress her heart with sadness and drown her in tears for the last day or two of their being together and advice of the most important and applicable nature must of course flow from her wise lips in their parting conference in her closet Cautions against the violence of such noblemen and baronets as delight in forcing young ladies away to some remote farm-house must at such a moment relieve the fulness of her heart.

Under these unpromising auspices the parting took place and the journey began It was performed with suitable quietness and uneventful safety Neither robbers nor tempests befriended them nor one lucky overturn to introduce them to the hero Nothing more alarming occurred than a fear on Mrs Allen's side of having once left her clogs behind her at an inn and that fortunately proved to be groundless.

They arrived at Bath Catherine was all eager delight -- her eyes were here there everywhere as they approached its fine and striking environs and afterwards drove through those streets which conducted them to the hotel She was come to be happy and she felt happy already.

"""How uncomfortable it is "" whispered Catherine ""not to have a single acquaintance here """"Yes my dear "" replied Mrs Allen with perfect serenity ""it is very uncomfortable indeed What shall we do The gentlemen and ladies at this table look as if they wondered why we came here -- we seem forcing ourselves into their party."""

After some time they received an offer of tea from one of their neighbours it was thankfully accepted and this introduced a light conversation with the gentleman who offered it which was the only time that anybody spoke to them during the evening till they were discovered and joined by Mr Allen when the dance was over.

She was looked at however and with some admiration for in her own hearing two gentlemen pronounced her to be a pretty girl Such words had their due effect she immediately thought the evening pleasanter than she had found it before -- her humble vanity was contented -- she felt more obliged to the two young men for this simple praise than a true-quality heroine would have been for fifteen sonnets in celebration of her charms and went to her chair in good humour with everybody and perfectly satisfied with her share of public attention.

"""No trouble I assure you madam Then forming his features into a set smile and affectedly softening his voice he added with a simpering air ""Have you been long in Bath madam """"About a week sir "" replied Catherine trying not to laugh eally "" with affected astonishment hy should you be surprised sir """"Why indeed "" said he in his natural tone ""But some emotion must appear to be raised by your reply and surprise is more easily assumed and not less reasonable than any other Now let us go on Were you never here before madam """"Never sir."""

Mr Tilney was polite enough to seem interested in what she said and she kept him on the subject of muslins till the dancing recommenced Catherine feared as she listened to their discourse that he indulged himself a little too much with the foibles of others.

Mrs Allen immediately recognized the features of a former schoolfellow and intimate whom she had seen only once since their respective marriages and that many years ago Their joy on this meeting was very great as well it might since they had been contented to know nothing of each other for the last fifteen years Compliments on good looks now passed and after observing how time had slipped away since they were last together how little they had thought of meeting in Bath and what a pleasure it was to see an old friend they proceeded to make inquiries and give intelligence as to their families sisters and cousins talking both together far more ready to give than to receive information and each hearing very little of what the other said.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness
Mrs Allen had no similar information to give no similar triumphs to press on the unwilling and unbelieving ear of her friend and was forced to sit and appear to listen to all these maternal effusions consoling herself however with the discovery which her keen eye soon made that the lace on Mrs Thorpe's pelisse was not half so handsome as that on her own.

"""The very picture of him indeed "" cried the mother -- and ""I should have known her anywhere for his sister "" was repeated by them all two or three times over For a moment Catherine was surprised."

The whole being explained many obliging things were said by the Miss Thorpes of their wish of being better acquainted with her of being considered as already friends through the friendship of their brothers etc which Catherine heard with pleasure and answered with all the pretty expressions she could command and as the first proof of amity she was soon invited to accept an arm of the eldest Miss Thorpe and take a turn with her about the room Catherine was delighted with this extension of her Bath acquaintance and almost forgot Mr Tilney while she talked to Miss Thorpe Friendship is certainly the finest balm for the pangs of disappointed love.

Catherine then ran directly upstairs and watched Miss Thorpe's progress down the street from the drawing-room window admired the graceful spirit of her walk the fashionable air of her figure and dress and felt grateful as well she might for the chance which had procured her such a friend.

As soon as divine service was over the Thorpes and Allens eagerly joined each other and after staying long enough in the pump-room to discover that the crowd was insupportable and that there was not a genteel face to be seen which everybody discovers every Sunday throughout the season they hastened away to the Crescent to breathe the fresh air of better company Here Catherine and Isabella arm in arm again tasted the sweets of friendship in an unreserved conversation they talked much and with much enjoyment but again was Catherine disappointed in her hope of reseeing her partner.

Mrs Allen was now quite happy -- quite satisfied with Bath She had found some acquaintance had been so lucky too as to find in them the family of a most worthy old friend and as the completion of good fortune had found these friends by no means so expensively dressed as herself.

"Her daily expressions were no longer ""I wish we had some acquaintance in Bath "" They were changed into ""How glad I am we have met with Mrs Thorpe "" and she was as eager in promoting the intercourse of the two families as her young charge and Isabella themselves could be never satisfied with the day unless she spent the chief of it by the side of Mrs Thorpe in what they called conversation but in which there was scarcely ever any exchange of opinion and not often any resemblance of subject for Mrs Thorpe talked chiefly of her children and Mrs Allen of her gowns."

But the Countess and the manufacturer's wife，who had in their souls an unreasonable hatred for the people that favor a Republic，and the same instinctive tenderness that all women have for a decorative，despotic government，felt themselves drawn，in spite of them－selves，toward this prostitute so full of dignity，whose sentiments so strongly resembled their own．	O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust
The basket was empty．By ten o'clock they had easily exhausted the contents and regretted that there was not more．Conversation continued for some time，but a little more coldly since they had finished eating．	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness
The man，rattling like a crackled locomotive，had too much trouble in breathing to talk while eating，but his wife was never silent．She told all her impressions at the arrival of the Prussians，what they did，what they said，reviling them because they cost her some money，and because she had two sons in the army．She addressed herself especially to the Countess，flattered by being able to talk with a lady of quality．	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger
Loiseau，leaving his place，went to speak with the innkeeper in a low tone of voice．The great man laughed，shook，and squeaked，his corpulence quivered with joy at the jokes of his neighbor，and he bought of him six cases of wine for spring，after the Prussians had gone．	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness
They found themselves in a square，with a church at one end，and some low houses on either side， where they perceived some Prussian soldiers．The first one they saw was paring potatoes．The second，further off，was cleaning the hairdresser's shop．Another，bearded to the eyes，was tending a troublesome brat，cradling it and trying to appease it；and the great peasant women，whose husbands were“away in the army，”indicated by signs to their obedient conquerors the work they wished to have done：cutting wood，cooking the soup，grinding the coffee，or what not．One of them even washed the linen of his hostess，an impotent old grandmother．The Count，astonished，asked questions of the beadle who came out of the rectory．	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O B-EMO I-EMO	surprise
Cornudet，indignant at the cordial relations between the conquerors，and the conquered，preferred to shut himself up in the inn．Loiseau had a joke for the occasion：“They will repeople the land．”	O B-EMO I-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger
Everybody staved in the kitchen and discussed the situation endlessly，imagining all sorts of unlikely things．Perhaps they would be retained as hostages but to what end or taken prisoners or rather a consider able ransom might be demanded．At this thought a panic prevailed．The richest were the most frightened，al－ready seeing themselves constrained to pay for their lives with sacks of gold poured into the hands of this insolent soldier．	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O B-EMO I-EMO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear
Then Ball-of-Fat was immediately surrounded，questioned，and solicited by all to disclose the mystery of his visit．She resisted，at first，but soon becoming exasperated，she said：“What does he want？You really want to know what he wants？He wants to sleep with me．”	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CAU	anger
Even gaiety returned，so funny did the whole story seem to them at last．The Count found some of the jokes a little off color，but they were so well told that he was forced to smile．In his turn，Loiseau came out with some still boldertales，and yet nobody was wounded．	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO O O O O O O O O O O	happiness
As soon as they entered the house she went to her room and did not appear again．The disquiet was extreme．What were they to do？If she continued to resist，what an embarrassment！	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear
“Delightful！A very gentle nature，and well educated，besides；then she is an artist to the tips of her fingers，sings beautifully，and draws to perfection．”	O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness
Ball-of－Fat，in the haste and distraction of her rising， had not thought of anything； and she looked at them exasperated，suffocating with rage，at all of them eating so placidly．A tumultuous anger swept over her at first，and she opened her mouth to cry out at them， to hurl at them a flood of injury which mounted to her lips；but she could hot speak，her exasperation strangled her．	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger
But my heart was beating with excitement as I walked down the road，because in my hand I carried the letter that my father had given me just before he died．‘Davie，’he had said，‘when I am dead，take this to the house of Shaws，near Cramond．That's where I came from，and that's where you must go．Put this letter into the hands of Ebenezer Balfour．’	O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness
Now I began to ask people on the road for the house of Shaws．Their answers worried me a little．Some people seemed surprised，some afraid，and some angry，when I spoke the name of Ebenezer Balfour．I could not understand this，but it was too far to go back to Essendean that day， and I wanted to find the rest of the Balfour family very much .

After supper he said suddenly，‘Davie，I've been thinking．I promised your father a bit of money for ye before ye were born．A promise is a promise—and so I'm going to give ye forty pounds！’ These last words seemed very painful to him．He added，in a kind of scream，‘Scots！’	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO O O	sadness
After a while I realized that I must be somewhere inside the ship，which was moving very fast through the water．‘I've been kidnapped！’I thought angrily．It was clear that my uncle and the captain had planned it together．	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O O O O O O O O O	anger
As he spoke，two sailors carried Ransome into the cabin His face was as white as a sheet，and he did not move．My blood ran cold when I saw him．	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O B-CAU	fear
But I could not forget poor Ransome．As the days passed，I became more and more worried．I knew that，when the ship arrived in the Carolinas，I would no longer be a free man，but a slave．I thought hard，but there did not seem to be any way of escaping．	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O O	fear
‘They're going to attack you，and murder you！’ I told him �What！’he cried，jumping up．‘Will ye stand with me，against them？’‘I will！ I'm no thief or murderer！’I replied bravely．‘Are ye for King George？’	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O B-EMO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear
I could not understand why they did not come to help me．I continued shouting wildly，although I could no longer see them．And then，I lay down and cried for the second time．This time I wasn't sad，but angry，because I thought that they had left me to die alone in that terrible place．	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger
How stupid of me not to realize that it was possible to get to Mull，twice a day，at low tide！Now I felt very grateful to the boatmen for guessing my problem，and coming back to help me． I walked towards the smoke that I had seen so often from Earraid，and reached a long，low house built of stone．	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness
I listened with interest to everything that they told me．But I liked it best when I heard Alan described as a fine man and an honest Highlander．When I got out of the boat in Appin， I sat down among some trees to decide what to do next．	O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness
He stopped us in the road，to give the killer a better chance to shoot Campbell！’Now I felt a new kind of fear． My life was in serious danger， although I had not done anything wrong．My mouth felt dry， and for a moment I could not move．	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear
But when I woke up again， on the third day，I felt much better， although not very strong． I noticed that Alan was looking very ashamed， and I realized at once what had hap pened．‘David，’ he said miserably，‘I've lost all our money at cards， yours as well as mine．’‘No，no，ye haven't lost it！cried Cluny．	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness
He was worried about my health， and offered me a hand when we crossed a river or climbed a hill．But after two or three days，when he realized that I was still angry with him， he too became angry，and laughed at me when I fell， or seemed tired．	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU B-EMO I-EMO I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O	anger
Soon I arrived in Queensferry．When I saw people looking strangely at me，and realized how dirty my clothes were， I be gan to feel afraid． Would Mr Rankeillor want to talk to me？How could I prove who I was？ I had no papers with me． I was too ashamed to ask any of the townspeople for help，so I walked up and down，not knowing what to do．	O O O O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust

This will had both worried and annoyed Mr Utterson． To alawyer it was an unusual and dangerous kind of will． It was bad enough when Edward Hyde was only an unknown name，but now that the lawyer knew something about Hyde， the will worried him more than ever． It had seemed like madness before；	O O O O B-EMO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O	fear

Sadly， he never saw me He was much older than my mother when they married， and died six months before I was born．My father's death made my beautiful young mother very unhappy， and she knew she would find life extremely difficult with a new baby and no husband.

I spent a wonderfully happy two weeks there，playing all day on the beach with Emily，and sleeping in my own little bed on the ship I am sure I was in love with little Emily in my childish way， and I cried bitterly when we had to say goodbye at the end of the holiday． But on the way home to Blunderstone， Peggotty looked at me very worriedly.

And when we arrived home， I could not help showing my mother how very miserable I was． I went straight to my room and lay sobbing on my bed，which made my poor mother very unhappy too． As she sat beside me， holding my hand， Mr Murdstone suddenly came in．	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO O O O O O O O	sadness
I was still very young，and I was very frightened of him． If he had said one kind word to me， perhaps I would have liked and trusted him，and my life would have been different Instead， I hated him for the influence he had over my dear mother，who wanted to be kind to me， but also wanted to please her new husband．	O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness
Instead， I hated him for the influence he had over my dear mother，who wanted to be kind to me， but also wanted to please her new husband． That evening Mr Murdstone's sister arrived to ‘help’my mother in the house． A tall dark lady， with a stern， frowning face，she looked and sounded very much like her brother．	O O O B-EMO I-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust
But he did not listen to me In my bedroom，he held my arms and started hitting me with the stick I managed to get hold of his hand， and bit deep into it He cried out angrily，and began to hit me as hard as he could．Above the noise of my screams， I could hear my mother and Peggotty crying outside the door.

However， my home even with the Murdstones there seemed a much pleasanter place than school，and I was glad when the Christmas holidays arrived， and I was allowed to return to Blunderstone I was a little surprised to find that my mother had a new baby， and I could see at once that she was not well.

My stepfather and his sister seemed to hate me even more than before， if that were possible， and they made my life quite miserable whenever they could In fact，I was almost pleased when it was time to return to school， and see Traddles and Steerforth again As the cart drove away， I remember my mother standing outside our house，with her baby in her arms smiling sadly at me.

I knew the truth �Your mother is dead，’ she said I was already sobbing loudly and I felt I was an orphan，quite alone in the world Mrs Creakle packed my case herself，and sent me home on the coach for the funeral.

So next morning Mr Barkis appeared at the door with his cart， and Peggotty's cases were put on it We climbed up and sat beside him Peggotty was naturally a little sad to leave her old home， where she had been so happy with my mother and me， and at first she cried a little But when Mr Barkis saw her drying her eyes and looking more cheerful， he too began to look happier， and he whispered to me ‘Barkis is willing！You told her that！’ Aloud he said to Peggotty，‘Are you comfortable？’	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness
You'll always be welcome to come and stay！’So when I returned to Blunderstone， Peggotty had become Mrs Barkis， and I was glad to think of her in her own house，with a husband to take care of her At home， my stepfather and his sister did not seem pleased to see me， and were clearly trying to find a way of getting rid of me.

All the warehouse workers were coarse， rough people who were used to working in dirty conditions for long hours No words can describe the horror I felt， when I realized what my life was going to be like from now on I was deeply ashamed at having such a job and I was also afraid that I would forget everything I had learnt from my mother and my teachers.

When I knocked at the door，Peggotty opened it，and did not recognize me for a moment．I had continued to write to her regularly，but we had not seen each other for seven years，and I was no longer the small boy she remembered．But when she realized I was her Master David，she sobbed and sobbed with delight，holding me in her arms as she had always done．Soon she was calmer，and we talked about the events of the last few years．	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness
What a lovely girl！And what a coarse young man she's engaged to！’I was shocked by these unexpectedly cold words．But when I turned to him and saw him smiling，I replied warmly，‘Ah，Steerforth！You pretend to laugh at people who are poorer or less educated than yourself，but I've just seen you spend the whole evening with the Peggotty family，making them happy！	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise

Our house is almost at the edge of the Seam I only have topass a few gates to reach the scruffy field called the Meadow Separating the Meadow from the woods in fact enclosing all of District 12 is a high chain-link fence topped with barbedwire loops In theory it's supposed to be electrified twentyfour hours a day as a deterrent to the predators that live in the woods ！ packs of wild dogs lone cougars bears ！ that used to threaten our streets But since we're lucky to get two orthree hours of electricity in the evenings it's usually safe to touch Even so I always take a moment to listen carefully for the hum that means the fence is live Right now it's silent as a stone Concealed by a clump of bushes I flatten out on my belly and slide under a two-foot stretch that's been loose for years There are several other weak spots in the fence but this one is so close to home I almost always enter the woods here.

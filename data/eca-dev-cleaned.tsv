About a year later Mr Semple died It was an untimely death one of those fortuitous and in a way insignificant episodes which are nevertheless dramatic in a dull way to those most concerned He was seized with a cold in the chest late in the fall--one of those seizures ordinarily attributed to wet feet or to going out on a damp day without an overcoat--and had insisted on going to business when Mrs Semple urged him to stay at home and recuperate He was in his way a very determined person not obstreperously so but quietly and under the surface Business was a great urge He saw himself soon to be worth about fifty thousand dollars Then this cold--nine more days of pneumonia--and he was dead The shoe store was closed for a few days the house was full of sympathetic friends and church people There was a funeral with burial service in the Callowhill Presbyterian Church to which they belonged and then he was buried Mrs Semple cried bitterly The shock of death affected her greatly and left her for a time in a depressed state A brother of hers David Wiggin undertook for the time being to run the shoe business for her There was no will but in the final adjustment which included the sale of the shoe business there being no desire on anybody's part to contest her right to all the property she received over eighteen thousand dollars She continued to reside in the Front Street house and was considered a charming and interesting widow.

And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely gardenFirst however she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this `for it might end you know ' said Alice to herself `in my going out altogether like a candleI wonder what I should be like then ' And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O B-EMO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear
Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it and found in it a very small cake on which the words `EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants`Well I'll eat it ' said Alice `and if it makes me grow larger I can reach the key and if it makes me grow smaller I can creep under the door so either way I'll get into the garden and I don't care which happens ' She ate a little bit and said anxiously to herself `Which way Which way holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size: to be sure this generally happens when one eats cake but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way she set to work and very soon finished off the cake.

Those who were nearest to the boat threw themselves into it others sprang into the sea but before I could save myself the whale plunged suddenly into the depths of the ocean leaving me clinging to a piece of the wood which we had brought to make our fire Meanwhile a breeze had sprung up and in the confusion that ensued on board our vessel in hoisting the sails and taking up those who were in the boat and clinging to its sides no one missed me and I was left at the mercy of the waves All that day I floated up and down now beaten this way now that and when night fell I despaired for my life but weary and spent as I was I clung to my frail support and great was my joy when the morning light showed me that I had drifted against an island.

They were in effect riding somewhat carelessly and with the ease of men whose feat was performed and who expected no more opposition Full in the midst was Lilias entirely muffled and pinioned by a large plaid drawn closely round her and held upon the front of the saddle of a large tall horse ridden by a slender light-limbed wiry groom whom Malcolm knew as Christopher Hall a retainer of the Duke of Albany and beside him rode her captor Sir Walter Stewart a man little above twenty but with a bronzed hardened reckless expression that made him look much older and of huge height and giant buildMalcolm knew him well and regarded him with unmitigated horror and dread both from the knowledge of his ruffianly violence even towards his father from fear of his intentions and from the misery that his brutal jests scoffs and practical jokes had often personally inflicted:  and the sight of his sister in the power of this wicked man was the realization of all his worst fears But ere there was time for more than one strong pang of consternation and constitutional terror Sir James's shout of 'StAndrew for the right ' was ringing out echoed by all the fifteen in ambush with him as simultaneously they leapt forward	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear

He had shot up suddenly to a fair height had almost lost his lameness and gained much more appearance of health and power of enduring fatigue His nerves had become less painfully sensitive and when after his first skirmish during which he had kept close to King James far too much terrified to stir an inch from him he had not only found himself perfectly safe but had been much praised for his valour he had been so much pleased with himself that he quite wished for another occasion of displaying his bravery and what with use and what with the increasing spirit of pugnacity he was as sincere as Ralf Percy in abusing the French for never coming to a pitched battle Perhaps indeed Malcolm spoke even more eagerly than Ralf in his own surprise and gratification at finding himself no coward and his fear lest Percy should detect that he ever had been supposed to be such.

To this the deputies consented and the next day was fixed for the surrender The difficulty was as Henry had found at Harfleur Rouen and many other places to enforce forbearance on his soldiery who regarded plunder as their lawful prey the enemy as their natural game and the trouble a city had given them as a cause for unmercifulness The more time changed his army from the feudal gathering of English country gentlemen and yeomen to mercenary bands of men-at-arms the mere greedy rapacious and insubordinate became their temper Well knowing the greatness of the peril and that the very best of his captains had scarcely the will if they had the power to restrain the license that soon became barbarity unimaginable he spoke sadly overnight of his dread of the day of surrender when it might prove impossible to prevent deeds that would be not merely a blot on his scutcheon but a shame to human nature looking back to the exultation with which he had entered Harfleur as a mere effect of boyish ignorance and thoughtlessness.

James feared he had been mistaken and looked to the influence of Esclairmonde to repair the evil if perchance she should follow the Queen to France And this it was almost certain she must do since she was entirely dependent upon the Countess of Hainault and could not obtain admission to a nunnery without recovering a portion of her estates.

James smiled and coloured with pleasure the fantastic message was not devoid of reality in the days when young imaginative spirits tried to hide the prose of war and policy in a bright mist of romantic fancy nor was he ashamed to bend his manly head in reverence to and even press to his lips his lady's first love- letter in the very sight of the satirical though sympathizing Bedford of whom he eagerly asked of the fair Joan's health and welfare and whether she were flouted by Queen Catherine.

And on this day when Esclairmonde herself had arrayed the fair child in the daintiest of rose-pink boddices edged with swan's-down the whitest of kirtles and softest of rosy veils the flush of anxiety on the pale little face made it so fair to look upon that as the maiden wistfully asked 'Think you he will flout me ' it was impossible not to laugh at the very notion 'Ah but I would be glad if he did for then I might bide with you.'

The words were in the most boorish dialect and pronunciation the stranger to Christina's ears because intercourse with foreign merchants and a growing affectation of Latinism had much refined the city language to which she was accustomed and she was surprised to perceive by her father's gesture and address that the speaker must be one of the lords of the castle She looked up and saw on the pathway above her a tall large-framed young man his skin dyed red with sun and wind in odd contrast with his pale shaggy hair moustache and beard as though the weather had tanned the one and bleached the other.

Esclairmonde would have been happy if no one had noticed her benevolence to the young Scot save Alice Montagu but she had to endure countless railleries from every lady from Countess Jaqueline downwards on the unmistakable evidence that her heart had spoken and her grave dignity had less effect in silencing them than usual so diverting was the alleged triumph over her propriety well as they knew that she would have done the same for the youngest horse-boy or the oldest man-at-arms.

If the illness had only been confessed those who watched the King anxiously would have had more hope but he was hotly angered at any hint of his needing care and though he sometimes relieved oppression by causing himself to be bled by a servant he never allowed that anything ailed him it was always the hot weather the anxious tidings the long pageant that wearied him--things that were wont to be like gnats on a lion's mane.

Nothing had passed about Patrick Drummond nor the high words of last night Henry seemed to have forgotten them between his bodily suffering and the anxiety of being forced to relinquish the command just before a battle and James would have felt it ungenerous to harass him at such a moment when absolutely committed to his charge For the present there was no fear of the prisoner being summarily executed by any lawful authority since the King had promised to take cognizance of the case and the chief danger was from his chance discovery by some lawless man-at-arms who would think himself doing good service by killing a concealed Scot under any circumstances.

Patrick's life was granted although it had been promised too late to send the intelligence back to the tent at Corbeil So far the purpose of his vow to St Andrew had been accomplished but with the probability that he should soon again be associated with Patrick came the sense of the failure in purpose and in promise Patrick would not reproach him he well knew--nay would rejoice in the change but even this certainty galled him and made him dread his cousin's presence as likely to bring him a sense of shame What would Patrick think of his letting a lady be absolutely compelled to marry him Might he not say it was the part of Walter Stewart over again Indeed Malcolm remembered how carefully King James was prevented from hearing the means by which the Countess intended to make the lady his own and a sensation came over him that it was profanation to call on St Andrew to bless what was to be brought about by such means Why was it that as his eyes fell on the face of King Henry the whole world and all his projects acquired so different a colouring and a sentence he had once heard Esclairmonde quote would come to him constantly:  'My son think not to buy off God It is thyself that He requires not thy gifts.'

Mariel and Joel both felt a flood of relief bordering on elation “I can’t believe that fucker is finally out of here ” Joel said to his sister “I hope we never see him again I hate him	O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness
For a few days the house was peaceful They spoke to each other in soft voices @they snuggled close on the couch to read stories they watched movies without interruptions They felt happy.

For several weeks Felix made no effort to see the children or even to contact them by telephone He felt too bitter and upset and would tell friends and relatives “They all ganged up against me together She has brainwashed the children to think everything is my fault	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness

With Felix out of the house Mariel’s relationship with her mother became better in some ways and more difficult in others Mom was noticeably more patient and less grouchy She would even smile and laugh sometimes and the attention she paid the children was more focused than they could remember in many years.

She didn’t want her mother to have a kind of authority that Mariel wasn’t used to and she felt somewhat pushed away emotionally Yet at the same time her mother seemed more present and loving The changes left Mariel feeling confused.

After two or three months had gone by the relaxed and cooperative atmosphere in the home began to deteriorate The children’s complicated and often contradictory emotions about @their parents’ separation began to erupt in various ways.

Back when their father was still living at home the children had for years stuffed away their bitterness sadness and fear about the abuse of Mom that they heard and saw and the times when dad targeted them directly for his unkindness.

This backlog of distress was now tightly interwoven with their upset and guilt about the recent changes And now that Dad wasn’t in the home anymore and with Mom visibly stronger and happier the children felt safe to let loose demons they had been keeping tightly caged.

Mariel who for years had been hypermature like a second mother in the house started regressing into whining and demanding She wanted help choosing her clothes in the morning complained that she didn’t understand any of her homework and became unable to fall asleep without her mother Marty couldn’t settle down at night convinced that a monster was going to come to the house to kill them all.

The direction that Joel was taking was perhaps the most worrisome Since roughly three years earlier he had shown a tendency to pick up certain aspects of his father’s conduct particularly the swearing and yelling.

Kaleigh felt overwhelmed by her children’s unexpected emotional and behavioral backsliding Her own recovery could have been a full-time job but she had to support her children economically and care for them on top of everything that was stirring inside of her.

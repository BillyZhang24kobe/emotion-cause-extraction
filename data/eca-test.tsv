They wished to preserve their dignity，comprehending that in such meetings as these they represented in some degree their great country，and somewhat disgusted with the docility of her companions，the fat girl tried to show more pride than her neighbors，the honest women，and，as she felt that some one should set an example，she continued her attitude of resistance assumed at the beginning of the journey．	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear

Now I began to ask people on the road for the house of Shaws．Their answers worried me a little．Some people seemed surprised，some afraid，and some angry，when I spoke the name of Ebenezer Balfour．I could not understand this，but it was too far to go back to Essendean that day， and I wanted to find the rest of the Balfour family very much .

After supper he said suddenly，‘Davie，I've been thinking．I promised your father a bit of money for ye before ye were born．A promise is a promise—and so I'm going to give ye forty pounds！’ These last words seemed very painful to him．He added，in a kind of scream，‘Scots！’	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO O O	sadness
‘Oh man，are ye alive or a ghost？’he cried ‘Get me my medicine，Davie—it's for my heart．’I found the medicine bottle and gave him some．He soon began to look a little better． ‘Why did you lie to me？’I asked angrily．‘Why did you give me money？ And why did you try to kill me？ Answer me！’	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO O O O O O	anger
‘My uncle and I have to see the lawyer，sir，’I replied，‘so I'm afraid we may not have enough time．’	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO I-CAU I-CAU	fear
After a while I realized that I must be somewhere inside the ship，which was moving very fast through the water．‘I've been kidnapped！’I thought angrily．It was clear that my uncle and the captain had planned it together．	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O O O O O O O O O	anger
As he spoke，two sailors carried Ransome into the cabin His face was as white as a sheet，and he did not move．My blood ran cold when I saw him．	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O B-CAU	fear
But I could not forget poor Ransome．As the days passed，I became more and more worried．I knew that，when the ship arrived in the Carolinas，I would no longer be a free man，but a slave．I thought hard，but there did not seem to be any way of escaping．	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O O	fear
‘They're going to attack you，and murder you！’ I told him �What！’he cried，jumping up．‘Will ye stand with me，against them？’‘I will！ I'm no thief or murderer！’I replied bravely．‘Are ye for King George？’	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O B-EMO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear
I could not understand why they did not come to help me．I continued shouting wildly，although I could no longer see them．And then，I lay down and cried for the second time．This time I wasn't sad，but angry，because I thought that they had left me to die alone in that terrible place．	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger
How stupid of me not to realize that it was possible to get to Mull，twice a day，at low tide！Now I felt very grateful to the boatmen for guessing my problem，and coming back to help me． I walked towards the smoke that I had seen so often from Earraid，and reached a long，low house built of stone．	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness
I listened with interest to everything that they told me．But I liked it best when I heard Alan described as a fine man and an honest Highlander．When I got out of the boat in Appin， I sat down among some trees to decide what to do next．	O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness
He stopped us in the road，to give the killer a better chance to shoot Campbell！’Now I felt a new kind of fear． My life was in serious danger， although I had not done anything wrong．My mouth felt dry， and for a moment I could not move．	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear
We ran and ran， faster than I had ever run before， and my heart was beat ing wildly． Sometimes， to my surprise， Alan straightened his back and showed himself to the soldiers who were chasing us．	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise
Man， I'm surprised at ye，’ said Alan．‘Do ye not know that if a Campbell is killed， the accused has to go to court in Inveraray， in the heart of Campbell country？ When the Campbell lawyers have finished with ye，ye'll be dead！’This frightened me a little．‘ All right， Alan，’ I said，‘ I'll go with you．’	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear
But when I woke up， several hours later， the valley was full of redcoats， and Alan was looking worried again， ‘If they go up the sides of the mountains，they'll see us，’he said．‘We'll just have to stay here and hope they don't， When it's dark，we'll try to get past them．’	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear
But when I woke up again， on the third day，I felt much better， although not very strong． I noticed that Alan was looking very ashamed， and I realized at once what had hap pened．‘David，’ he said miserably，‘I've lost all our money at cards， yours as well as mine．’‘No，no，ye haven't lost it！cried Cluny．	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness
He was worried about my health， and offered me a hand when we crossed a river or climbed a hill．But after two or three days，when he realized that I was still angry with him， he too became angry，and laughed at me when I fell， or seemed tired．	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU B-EMO I-EMO I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O	anger
Soon I arrived in Queensferry．When I saw people looking strangely at me，and realized how dirty my clothes were， I be gan to feel afraid． Would Mr Rankeillor want to talk to me？How could I prove who I was？ I had no papers with me． I was too ashamed to ask any of the townspeople for help，so I walked up and down，not knowing what to do．	O O O O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust

I knew the truth �Your mother is dead，’ she said I was already sobbing loudly and I felt I was an orphan，quite alone in the world Mrs Creakle packed my case herself，and sent me home on the coach for the funeral.

So next morning Mr Barkis appeared at the door with his cart， and Peggotty's cases were put on it We climbed up and sat beside him Peggotty was naturally a little sad to leave her old home， where she had been so happy with my mother and me， and at first she cried a little But when Mr Barkis saw her drying her eyes and looking more cheerful， he too began to look happier， and he whispered to me ‘Barkis is willing！You told her that！’ Aloud he said to Peggotty，‘Are you comfortable？’	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness
You'll always be welcome to come and stay！’So when I returned to Blunderstone， Peggotty had become Mrs Barkis， and I was glad to think of her in her own house，with a husband to take care of her At home， my stepfather and his sister did not seem pleased to see me， and were clearly trying to find a way of getting rid of me.

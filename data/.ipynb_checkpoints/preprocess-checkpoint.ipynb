      "He stared at the boy and considered asking him why he looked so sad but hesitated because he thought it might sound rude He knew that sometimes people who were sad didn't want to be asked about it sometimes they'd offer the information themselves and sometimes they wouldn't stop talking about it for months on end but on this occasion Bruno thought that he should wait before saying anything He had discovered something during his exploration and now that he was finally talking to one of the people on the other side of the fence it seemed like a good idea to make the most of the opportunity.\n",
      "'We wore the armbands for a few months ' he said 'And then things changed again I came home one day and Mama said we couldn't live in our house any more—' 'That happened to me too ' shouted Bruno delighted that he wasn't the only boy who'd been forced to move 'The Fury came for dinner you see and the next thing I knew we moved here.\n",

      "There was half a stuffed chicken left over from lunch time and Bruno's eyes sparkled in delight for there were very few things in life that he enjoyed more than cold chicken with sage and onion stuffing He took a knife from the drawer and cut himself a few healthy slices and coated them with the stuffing before turning back to his friend.\n",
      "Bruno nodded and turned round and left the kitchen without looking back His stomach churned inside him and he thought for a moment that he was going to be sick He had never felt so ashamed in his life he had never imagined that he could behave so cruelly He wondered how a boy who thought he was a good person really could act in such a cowardly way towards a friend He sat in the living room for several hours but couldn't concentrate on his book and didn't dare to go back to the kitchen until later that evening when Lieutenant Kotler had already come back and collected Shmuel and taken him away again.\n",
      "'Shmuel ' he said running towards him and sitting down almost crying with relief and regret 'I'm so sorry Shmuel I don't know why I did it Say you'll forgive me.'\n",
      "'No Bruno ' said Gretel but she said this slowly because she had discovered something unusual in her hair and was examining it carefully 'Well can't someone just get them together and—'Bruno was interrupted by the sound of Gretel breaking into a piercing scream one that woke Mother up from her afternoon nap and brought her running into the bedroom to find out which of her children had murdered the other one While experimenting with her hair Gretel had found a tiny egg no bigger than the top of a pin.\n",

      "The appearance of Frank Cowperwood at this time was to say the least prepossessing and satisfactory Nature had destined him to be about five feet ten inches tall His head was large shapely notably commercial in aspect thickly covered with crisp dark-brown hair and fixed on a pair of square shoulders and a stocky body Already his eyes had the look that subtle years of thought bring They were inscrutable.\n",
      "It was true The condition of the finances of the state and city was most reprehensible Both State and city were rich enough but there were so many schemes for looting the treasury in both instances that when any new work had to be undertaken bonds were necessarily issued to raise the money.\n",
      "A tentative line incorporated by the North Pennsylvania Railway Company had been put into operation on a mile and a half of tracks extending from Willow Street along Front to Germantown Road and thence by various streets to what was then known as the Cohocksink Depot and it was thought that in time this mode of locomotion might drive out the hundreds of omnibuses which now crowded and made impassable the downtown streets Young Cowperwood had been greatly interested from the start Railway transportation as a whole interested him anyway but this particular phase was most fascinating.\n",
      "She was slightly taller than he--though he was now his full height (five feet ten and one-half inches)--and despite her height shapely artistic in form and feature and with a certain unconscious placidity of soul which came more from lack of understanding than from force of character Her hair was the color of a dried English walnut rich and plentiful and her complexion waxen--cream wax---with lips of faint pink and eyes that varied from gray to blue and from gray to brown according to the light in which you saw them Her hands were thin and shapely her nose straight her face artistically narrow She was not brilliant not active but rather peaceful and statuesque without knowing it Cowperwood was carried away by her appearance Her beauty measured up to his present sense of the artistic She was lovely he thought--gracious dignified If he could have his choice of a wife this was the kind of a girl he would like to have.\n",
      "At first when Frank called she did not have much to say She was gracious but the burden of conversation fell on her husband Cowperwood watched the varying expression of her face from time to time and if she had been at all psychic she must have felt something Fortunately she was not Semple talked to him pleasantly because in the first place Frank was becoming financially significant was suave and ingratiating and in the next place he was anxious to get richer and somehow Frank represented progress to him in that line.\n",
      "Money was so scarce that it could fairly be said not to exist at all Capital frightened by uncertain trade and money conditions everywhere retired to its hiding-places in banks vaults tea-kettles and stockings The country seemed to be going to the dogs War with the South or secession was vaguely looming up in the distance The temper of the whole nation was nervous People dumped their holdings on the market in order to get money Tighe discharged three of his clerks.\n",
      "During all these days young Cowperwood was following these financial complications with interest He was not disturbed by the cause of slavery or the talk of secession or the general progress or decline of the country except in so far as it affected his immediate interests He longed to become a stable financier but now that he saw the inside of the brokerage business he was not so sure that he wanted to stay in it Gambling in stocks according to conditions produced by this panic seemed very hazardous A number of brokers failed He saw them rush in to Tighe with anguished faces and ask that certain trades be canceled Their very homes were in danger they said They would be wiped out their wives and children put out on the street.\n",

      "In the midst of this early work he married Mrs Semple There was no vast to-do about it as he did not want any and his bride-to-be was nervous fearsome of public opinion His family did not entirely approve She was too old his mother and father thought and then Frank with his prospects could have done much better His sister Anna fancied that Mrs Semple was designing which was of course not true His brothers Joseph and Edward were interested but not certain as to what they actually thought since Mrs Semple was good-looking and had some money.\n",
      "And Mrs Cowperwood in spite of the difference in their years appeared to be a fit mate for him at this time She was once awakened and for the time being clinging responsive dreamy His mood and hers was for a baby and in a little while that happy expectation was whispered to him by her She had half fancied that her previous barrenness was due to herself and was rather surprised and delighted at the proof that it was not so.\n",
      "This current war-spirit was strange The people seemed to him to want to hear nothing but the sound of the drum and fife to see nothing but troops of which there were thousands now passing through on their way to the front carrying cold steel in the shape of guns at their shoulders to hear of war and the rumors of war.\n",

      "He was not of those who complained bitterly of the excessive war taxes though he knew them to be trying to many Some of the stories of death and disaster moved him greatly but alas they were among the unaccountable fortunes of life and could not be remedied by him.\n",
      "Aileen always reminded Cowperwood of a high-stepping horse without a check-rein He met her at various times shopping with her mother out driving with her father and he was always interested and amused at the affected bored tone she assumed before him--the \"Oh dear Oh dear Life is so tiresome don't you know \" when as a matter of fact every moment of it was of thrilling interest to her Cowperwood took her mental measurement exactly A girl with a high sense of life in her romantic full of the thought of love and its possibilities.\n",
      "There were then two famous American sculptors Powers and Hosmer of whose work he had examples but Ellsworth told him that they were not the last word in sculpture and that he should look into the merits of the ancients He finally secured a head of David by Thorwaldsen which delighted him and some landscapes by Hunt Sully and Hart which seemed somewhat in the spirit of his new world.\n",
      "There was one line being laid out to within a few blocks of his new home--the Seventeenth and Nineteenth Street line it was called-- which interested him greatly He rode on it occasionally when he was delayed or did not wish to trouble about a vehicle It ran through two thriving streets of red-brick houses and was destined to have a great future once the city grew large enough As yet it was really not long enough.\n",
      "\"Well it's lovely now isn't it \" breathed Mrs Butler \"Sure you'll be happy here Sure you will When Eddie fixed the house we're in now says I: 'Eddie it's almost too fine for us altogether-- surely it is ' and he says says 'e 'Norah nothin' this side o' heavin or beyond is too good for ye'--and he kissed me Now what d'ye think of that fer a big hulkin' gossoon\n",
      "Aileen had swept on to Cowperwood and his mother who was near him She had removed from her arm the black satin ribbon which held her train and kicked the skirts loose and free Her eyes gleamed almost pleadingly for all her hauteur like a spirited collie's and her even teeth showed beautifully.\n",
      "She had stood before her mirror between eight and nine--it was nine-fifteen before she was really ready--and pondered over what she should wear There were two tall pier-glasses in her wardrobe-- an unduly large piece of furniture--and one in her closet door She stood before the latter looking at her bare arms and shoulders her shapely figure thinking of the fact that her left shoulder had a dimple and that she had selected garnet garters decorated with heart-shaped silver buckles The corset could not be made quite tight enough at first and she chided her maid Kathleen Kelly She studied how to arrange her hair and there was much ado about that before it was finally adjusted She penciled her eyebrows and plucked at the hair about her forehead to make it loose and shadowy She cut black court-plaster with her nail-shears and tried different-sized pieces in different places Finally she found one size and one place that suited her She turned her head from side to side looking at the combined effect of her hair her penciled brows her dimpled shoulder and the black beauty-spot If some one man could see her as she was now some time Which man That thought scurried back like a frightened rat into its hole She was for all her strength afraid of the thought of the one--the very deadly--the man.\n",
      "Cowperwood understood He walked away He was quite warm and tense now--almost nervous It was quite clear to him that he had done or was contemplating perhaps a very treacherous thing Under the current code of society he had no right to do it It was against the rules as they were understood by everybody Her father for instance--his father--every one in this particular walk of life However much breaking of the rules under the surface of things there might be the rules were still there As he had heard one young man remark once at school when some story had been told of a boy leading a girl astray and to a disastrous end \"That isn't the way at all.\"\n",
      "\"Fine let me tell you I stepped on a lady's dress over there last dance She was terribly angry She gave me such a look.\"\n",
      "Again it was so very evident in so many ways that force was the answer--great mental and physical force Why these giants of commerce and money could do as they pleased in this life and did He had already had ample local evidence of it in more than one direction Worse--the little guardians of so-called law and morality the newspapers the preachers the police and the public moralists generally so loud in their denunciation of evil in humble places were cowards all when it came to corruption in high ones They did not dare to utter a feeble squeak until some giant had accidentally fallen and they could do so without danger to themselves Then O Heavens the palaver What beatings of tom-toms What mouthings of pharisaical moralities--platitudes Run now good people for you may see clearly how evil is dealt with in high places It made him smile.\n",
      "She knew it was he without turning He came beside her and she looked up smiling the reverie evoked by Schubert partly vanishing-- or melting into another mood Suddenly he bent over and pressed his lips firmly to hers His mustache thrilled her with its silky touch She stopped playing and tried to catch her breath for strong as she was it affected her breathing her heart was beating like a triphammer She did not say \"Oh \" or \"You mustn't \" but rose and walked over to a window where she lifted a curtain pretending to look out She felt as though she might faint so intensely happy was she.\n",

      "for the time being there was love-making the usual billing and cooing of lovers in a simple and much less than final fashion and the lovely horseback rides together under the green trees of the approaching spring were idyllic Cowperwood awakened to a sense of joy in life such as he fancied in the blush of this new desire he had never experienced before Lillian had been lovely in those early days in which he had first called on her in North Front Street and he had fancied himself unspeakably happy at that time but that was nearly ten years since and he had forgotten Since then he had had no great passion no notable liaison and then all at once in the midst of his new great business prosperity Aileen.\n",
      "\"You know it can't stop this way don't you You know it This isn't the end Now if--\" He explained the whole theory of illicit meetings calmly dispassionately \"You are perfectly safe except for one thing chance exposure It might just so happen and then of course there would be a great deal to settle for Mrs Cowperwood would never give me a divorce she has no reason to If I should clean up in the way I hope to--if I should make a million--I wouldn't mind knocking off now I don't expect to work all my days I have always planned to knock off at thirty-five I'll have enough by that time Then I want to travel It will only be a few more years now If you were free--if your father and mother were dead\"--curiously she did not wince at this practical reference--\"it would be a different matter.\"\n",
      "These two felt unutterably bound to each other Cowperwood once he came to understand her fancied that he had found the one person with whom he could live happily the rest of his life She was so young so confident so hopeful so undismayed All these months since they had first begun to reach out to each other he had been hourly contrasting her with his wife As a matter of fact his dissatisfaction though it may be said to have been faint up to this time was now surely tending to become real enough Still his children were pleasing to him his home beautiful Lillian phlegmatic and now thin was still not homely.\n",

      "Suddenly a helpful thought occurred to him Butler and Mollenhauer and Simpson were long on local street-railways They must combine to support the situation and protect their interests They could see the big bankers Drexel & Co and Cooke & Co and others and urge them to sustain the market They could strengthen things generally by organizing a buying ring and under cover of their support if they would he might sell enough to let him out and even permit him to go short and make something--a whole lot It was a brilliant thought worthy of a greater situation and its only weakness was that it was not absolutely certain of fulfillment.\n",
      "They were allied in no one particular financial proposition any more than Mollenhauer and Butler were And besides in all probability Cowperwood was no fool He was not equally guilty with Stener the latter had loaned him money The Senator reflected on whether he should broach some such subtle solution of the situation as had occurred to him to his colleagues but he decided not Really Mollenhauer was too treacherous a man to work with on a thing of this kind It was a splendid chance but dangerous He had better go it alone For the present they should demand of Stener that he get Cowperwood to return the five hundred thousand dollars if he could If not Stener could be sacrificed for the benefit of the party if need be.\n",

      "Maggie felt as though she could see the firelight through her body and with that came also the conviction that Aunt Anne knew everything knew about Martin and the posted letter and the thoughts of escape Maggie herself was tired with the trial of her waiting day she was exhausted and was beating with all her resolve against a disappointment that hammered with a thundering noise somewhere far away in the recesses of her soul.\n",
      "\"I sometimes despair of you Maggie You will not think of others I don't wish to be hard or unjust but selfishness is the name of your greatest weakness.\"\n",
      "Maggie could only see his head and shoulders but she realised at once that he had been for a long time trying to catch her eye He smiled at her an intimate peculiar smile that sent the blood flooding to her face and made her heart beat with happiness At the moment of her smiling she realised that Miss Avies' dim eye was upon her.\n",

      "I can't help myself I love you Martin so that it's like hunger or thirst It's the only earthly passion that I've ever had And I'll tell you another thing It's the one terror of my earthly life that you'll leave me Now that I've got you back I'm afraid every time you go out of the house that you'll run away round the corner and never come back again.\n",
      "Two events occurred that filled her mind and made the week pass quickly One was that she received an answer to her adventurous letter the other was a remarkable conversation with Miss Caroline Smith The answer to her letter was lying on her plate when she came down to breakfast and Aunt Elizabeth was watching it with an excited stare.\n",
      "\"Two visions Just like the first The blazing light and the voice and telling him that the last night of the year's to be the time Caroline then began to be carried away by her excitement She talked faster and faster.\n",

      "But as the play continued she must listen It was her very first play and soon it was thrilling to her so that she forgot for a time even Martin Or rather Martin was mingled with it absorbed in it part of it and she was there too sharing with him the very action of the story.\n",
      "I advised that strongly against my sister's opinion because I thought you weren't happy You didn't make friends amongst our friends and I thought you should have the chance of finding some who were younger and gayer than we were.\n",

      "Meanwhile how they must all have been talking She felt no especial anger against Caroline Smith It had been her own fault for trusting that note to her honour Caroline had no honour of course Maggie might have guessed that from the way that she talked about other people.\n",
      "Martin dear try and write every day even if it's only the shortest line because it is dreadful to be shut up all day and I think of you all the time and wonder how you are Don't be unhappy Martin--that's the one thing I couldn't bear If you're not I'm not There's no reason to be unhappy about me.\n",
      "When she saw him she stood speechless where she was The change in him terrified her so that her heart seemed to leap into her throat choking her The colour had drained from his face leaving it dry and yellow He had an amazing resemblance to his father his eyes had exactly the same bewildered expression as though he were lost and yet he seemed quite calm his only movement was one hand that wandered up and down his waistcoat feeling the buttons one after the other.\n",
      "\"No I don't think I'll come I'm frightened I'm not what you think I'm untidy and careless and can't talk to strangers Perhaps I'll lose you altogether as a friend if I come.\"\n",
      "\"You know that it's better for me to go \" said Maggie \"We can't live together any more after what happened You and Aunt Elizabeth have been very very good to me but you know now that I'm a disappointment I haven't ever fitted into the life here I never shall.\"\n",
      "He did indeed seem to lead a mysterious life of his own and paid very little attention to Maggie asking her once whether she did not think The Golden Ass wonderful and what did she think of Petronius and when Maggie laughed and said that she was glad to say she never read anything he left her in an agitated horror Lady Rachel Seddon was very grand and splendid and frightened Katherine She was related to every kind of duke and marquis and although that fact did not impress Maggie in the least it did seem to remove Lady Rachel into quite another world.\n",
      "He knew just where he was and exactly whither he was going One afternoon when they were out in the motor together he took Maggie's hand under the rug and he held it so calmly so firmly with so kindly a benevolence that she could not be frightened or uncomfortable He was like a large friendly brother\n",
      "\"As to Paul I believe you'd be happy You'd have your home and your life and your friends Skeaton isn't so bad if you live in it I believe and Paul could get another living if you weren't happy there.\"\n",
      "\"Yes it is \" said Maggie \"I'm so sorry I never knew it was your mother It wasn't a very good painting I thought so I took it down If I had known of course I never would have touched it Oh Grace I AM so sorry.\"\n",
      "And that other life began to be dim and faint-even Martin was a little hidden and mysterious Strangely she was glad of that the only way that this could be carried through was by keeping the other out of it Would the two worlds mingle Would the faces and voices of those spirits be seen and heard again Would they leave Maggie now or plan to steal her back The whole future of her life depended on the answer to that\n",
      "She at once concluded that her husband had taken it and would shortly bring it back She waited for him till evening rather impatiently and wondering what could have kept him from her so long When night came without him she felt in despair and abused the talisman and its maker roundly In spite of her grief and anxiety however she did not lose her presence of mind but decided on a courageous though very unusual step.\n",
      "The prince and princess were now entirely happy and months slipped by unconsciously in the enjoyment of each other's society.\n",
      "The light in the prince's room surprised her and without disturbing the slave who slept across the threshold she entered the room and approaching the bed was still more astonished to find it occupied.\n",
      "At this awful sight I shrieked aloud in my grief and pain I threw myself on the ground and rent my clothes and tore my hair with sorrow Then fearing to be punished as his murderer by the unhappy father I raised the great stone which blocked the staircase and quitting the underground chamber made everything fast as before.\n",
      "King Armanos heard the princess with surprise and admiration then turning to Camaralzaman he said \"My son as your wife the Princess Badoura (whom I have hitherto looked on as my son-in-law) consents to share your hand and affections with my daughter I have only to ask if this marriage is agreeable to you and if you will consent to accept the crown which the Princess Badoura deserves to wear all her life but which she prefers to resign for love of you.\"\n",

      "Being ambitious to get ahead socially and financially he was very careful of whom or with whom he talked He was as much afraid of Agatha's she had expressing a rabid or unpopular political or social opinion as he was of being seen with an evil character though he had really no opinion of great political significance to express.\n",
      "There was a perfect plague of State banks great and small in those days issuing notes practically without regulation upon insecure and unknown assets and failing and suspending with astonishing rapidity and a knowledge of all these was an important requirement of Mr Cowperwood's position As a result he had become the soul of caution Unfortunately for him he lacked in a great measure the two things that are necessary for distinction in any field--magnetism and vision He was not destined to be a great financier though he was marked out to be a moderately successful one\n",
      "That was it Sure men lived on men Look at the slaves They were men That's what all this excitement was about these days Men killing other men--negroes\n",
      "It was at seventeen that he decided to leave school He had not graduated He had only finished the third year in high school but he had had enough Ever since his thirteenth year his mind had been on finance that is in the form in which he saw it manifested in Third Street There had been odd things which he had been able to do to earn a little money now and then.\n",

      "The appearance of Frank Cowperwood at this time was to say the least prepossessing and satisfactory Nature had destined him to be about five feet ten inches tall His head was large shapely notably commercial in aspect thickly covered with crisp dark-brown hair and fixed on a pair of square shoulders and a stocky body Already his eyes had the look that subtle years of thought bring They were inscrutable.\n",
      "It was true The condition of the finances of the state and city was most reprehensible Both State and city were rich enough but there were so many schemes for looting the treasury in both instances that when any new work had to be undertaken bonds were necessarily issued to raise the money.\n",
      "A tentative line incorporated by the North Pennsylvania Railway Company had been put into operation on a mile and a half of tracks extending from Willow Street along Front to Germantown Road and thence by various streets to what was then known as the Cohocksink Depot and it was thought that in time this mode of locomotion might drive out the hundreds of omnibuses which now crowded and made impassable the downtown streets Young Cowperwood had been greatly interested from the start Railway transportation as a whole interested him anyway but this particular phase was most fascinating.\n",
      "She was slightly taller than he--though he was now his full height (five feet ten and one-half inches)--and despite her height shapely artistic in form and feature and with a certain unconscious placidity of soul which came more from lack of understanding than from force of character Her hair was the color of a dried English walnut rich and plentiful and her complexion waxen--cream wax---with lips of faint pink and eyes that varied from gray to blue and from gray to brown according to the light in which you saw them Her hands were thin and shapely her nose straight her face artistically narrow She was not brilliant not active but rather peaceful and statuesque without knowing it Cowperwood was carried away by her appearance Her beauty measured up to his present sense of the artistic She was lovely he thought--gracious dignified If he could have his choice of a wife this was the kind of a girl he would like to have.\n",
      "At first when Frank called she did not have much to say She was gracious but the burden of conversation fell on her husband Cowperwood watched the varying expression of her face from time to time and if she had been at all psychic she must have felt something Fortunately she was not Semple talked to him pleasantly because in the first place Frank was becoming financially significant was suave and ingratiating and in the next place he was anxious to get richer and somehow Frank represented progress to him in that line.\n",
      "Money was so scarce that it could fairly be said not to exist at all Capital frightened by uncertain trade and money conditions everywhere retired to its hiding-places in banks vaults tea-kettles and stockings The country seemed to be going to the dogs War with the South or secession was vaguely looming up in the distance The temper of the whole nation was nervous People dumped their holdings on the market in order to get money Tighe discharged three of his clerks.\n",
      "During all these days young Cowperwood was following these financial complications with interest He was not disturbed by the cause of slavery or the talk of secession or the general progress or decline of the country except in so far as it affected his immediate interests He longed to become a stable financier but now that he saw the inside of the brokerage business he was not so sure that he wanted to stay in it Gambling in stocks according to conditions produced by this panic seemed very hazardous A number of brokers failed He saw them rush in to Tighe with anguished faces and ask that certain trades be canceled Their very homes were in danger they said They would be wiped out their wives and children put out on the street.\n",

      "She relapsed into additional protests but he kissed her the more There was a deadly persuasion to his caresses Semple had never displayed any such fire He aroused a force of feeling in her which had not previously been there She was afraid of it and ashamed.\n",
      "In the midst of this early work he married Mrs Semple There was no vast to-do about it as he did not want any and his bride-to-be was nervous fearsome of public opinion His family did not entirely approve She was too old his mother and father thought and then Frank with his prospects could have done much better His sister Anna fancied that Mrs Semple was designing which was of course not true His brothers Joseph and Edward were interested but not certain as to what they actually thought since Mrs Semple was good-looking and had some money.\n",
      "And Mrs Cowperwood in spite of the difference in their years appeared to be a fit mate for him at this time She was once awakened and for the time being clinging responsive dreamy His mood and hers was for a baby and in a little while that happy expectation was whispered to him by her She had half fancied that her previous barrenness was due to herself and was rather surprised and delighted at the proof that it was not so.\n",
      "This current war-spirit was strange The people seemed to him to want to hear nothing but the sound of the drum and fife to see nothing but troops of which there were thousands now passing through on their way to the front carrying cold steel in the shape of guns at their shoulders to hear of war and the rumors of war.\n",
      "Sympathy and affection were great things but desire and charm must endure or one was compelled to be sadly conscious of their loss So often now he saw young girls who were quite in his mood and who were exceedingly robust and joyous It was fine advisable practical to adhere to the virtues as laid down in the current social lexicon but if you had a sickly wife.\n",

      "He was not of those who complained bitterly of the excessive war taxes though he knew them to be trying to many Some of the stories of death and disaster moved him greatly but alas they were among the unaccountable fortunes of life and could not be remedied by him.\n",
      "Aileen always reminded Cowperwood of a high-stepping horse without a check-rein He met her at various times shopping with her mother out driving with her father and he was always interested and amused at the affected bored tone she assumed before him--the \"Oh dear Oh dear Life is so tiresome don't you know \" when as a matter of fact every moment of it was of thrilling interest to her Cowperwood took her mental measurement exactly A girl with a high sense of life in her romantic full of the thought of love and its possibilities.\n",
      "There were then two famous American sculptors Powers and Hosmer of whose work he had examples but Ellsworth told him that they were not the last word in sculpture and that he should look into the merits of the ancients He finally secured a head of David by Thorwaldsen which delighted him and some landscapes by Hunt Sully and Hart which seemed somewhat in the spirit of his new world.\n",
      "There was one line being laid out to within a few blocks of his new home--the Seventeenth and Nineteenth Street line it was called-- which interested him greatly He rode on it occasionally when he was delayed or did not wish to trouble about a vehicle It ran through two thriving streets of red-brick houses and was destined to have a great future once the city grew large enough As yet it was really not long enough.\n",
      "\"Well it's lovely now isn't it \" breathed Mrs Butler \"Sure you'll be happy here Sure you will When Eddie fixed the house we're in now says I: 'Eddie it's almost too fine for us altogether-- surely it is ' and he says says 'e 'Norah nothin' this side o' heavin or beyond is too good for ye'--and he kissed me Now what d'ye think of that fer a big hulkin' gossoon\n",
      "Aileen had swept on to Cowperwood and his mother who was near him She had removed from her arm the black satin ribbon which held her train and kicked the skirts loose and free Her eyes gleamed almost pleadingly for all her hauteur like a spirited collie's and her even teeth showed beautifully.\n",
      "She had stood before her mirror between eight and nine--it was nine-fifteen before she was really ready--and pondered over what she should wear There were two tall pier-glasses in her wardrobe-- an unduly large piece of furniture--and one in her closet door She stood before the latter looking at her bare arms and shoulders her shapely figure thinking of the fact that her left shoulder had a dimple and that she had selected garnet garters decorated with heart-shaped silver buckles The corset could not be made quite tight enough at first and she chided her maid Kathleen Kelly She studied how to arrange her hair and there was much ado about that before it was finally adjusted She penciled her eyebrows and plucked at the hair about her forehead to make it loose and shadowy She cut black court-plaster with her nail-shears and tried different-sized pieces in different places Finally she found one size and one place that suited her She turned her head from side to side looking at the combined effect of her hair her penciled brows her dimpled shoulder and the black beauty-spot If some one man could see her as she was now some time Which man That thought scurried back like a frightened rat into its hole She was for all her strength afraid of the thought of the one--the very deadly--the man.\n",
      "Cowperwood understood He walked away He was quite warm and tense now--almost nervous It was quite clear to him that he had done or was contemplating perhaps a very treacherous thing Under the current code of society he had no right to do it It was against the rules as they were understood by everybody Her father for instance--his father--every one in this particular walk of life However much breaking of the rules under the surface of things there might be the rules were still there As he had heard one young man remark once at school when some story had been told of a boy leading a girl astray and to a disastrous end \"That isn't the way at all.\"\n",
      "\"Fine let me tell you I stepped on a lady's dress over there last dance She was terribly angry She gave me such a look.\"\n",
      "Again it was so very evident in so many ways that force was the answer--great mental and physical force Why these giants of commerce and money could do as they pleased in this life and did He had already had ample local evidence of it in more than one direction Worse--the little guardians of so-called law and morality the newspapers the preachers the police and the public moralists generally so loud in their denunciation of evil in humble places were cowards all when it came to corruption in high ones They did not dare to utter a feeble squeak until some giant had accidentally fallen and they could do so without danger to themselves Then O Heavens the palaver What beatings of tom-toms What mouthings of pharisaical moralities--platitudes Run now good people for you may see clearly how evil is dealt with in high places It made him smile.\n",
      "She knew it was he without turning He came beside her and she looked up smiling the reverie evoked by Schubert partly vanishing-- or melting into another mood Suddenly he bent over and pressed his lips firmly to hers His mustache thrilled her with its silky touch She stopped playing and tried to catch her breath for strong as she was it affected her breathing her heart was beating like a triphammer She did not say \"Oh \" or \"You mustn't \" but rose and walked over to a window where she lifted a curtain pretending to look out She felt as though she might faint so intensely happy was she.\n",

      "for the time being there was love-making the usual billing and cooing of lovers in a simple and much less than final fashion and the lovely horseback rides together under the green trees of the approaching spring were idyllic Cowperwood awakened to a sense of joy in life such as he fancied in the blush of this new desire he had never experienced before Lillian had been lovely in those early days in which he had first called on her in North Front Street and he had fancied himself unspeakably happy at that time but that was nearly ten years since and he had forgotten Since then he had had no great passion no notable liaison and then all at once in the midst of his new great business prosperity Aileen.\n",
      "\"You know it can't stop this way don't you You know it This isn't the end Now if--\" He explained the whole theory of illicit meetings calmly dispassionately \"You are perfectly safe except for one thing chance exposure It might just so happen and then of course there would be a great deal to settle for Mrs Cowperwood would never give me a divorce she has no reason to If I should clean up in the way I hope to--if I should make a million--I wouldn't mind knocking off now I don't expect to work all my days I have always planned to knock off at thirty-five I'll have enough by that time Then I want to travel It will only be a few more years now If you were free--if your father and mother were dead\"--curiously she did not wince at this practical reference--\"it would be a different matter.\"\n",
      "These two felt unutterably bound to each other Cowperwood once he came to understand her fancied that he had found the one person with whom he could live happily the rest of his life She was so young so confident so hopeful so undismayed All these months since they had first begun to reach out to each other he had been hourly contrasting her with his wife As a matter of fact his dissatisfaction though it may be said to have been faint up to this time was now surely tending to become real enough Still his children were pleasing to him his home beautiful Lillian phlegmatic and now thin was still not homely.\n",

      "Suddenly a helpful thought occurred to him Butler and Mollenhauer and Simpson were long on local street-railways They must combine to support the situation and protect their interests They could see the big bankers Drexel & Co and Cooke & Co and others and urge them to sustain the market They could strengthen things generally by organizing a buying ring and under cover of their support if they would he might sell enough to let him out and even permit him to go short and make something--a whole lot It was a brilliant thought worthy of a greater situation and its only weakness was that it was not absolutely certain of fulfillment.\n",
      "They were allied in no one particular financial proposition any more than Mollenhauer and Butler were And besides in all probability Cowperwood was no fool He was not equally guilty with Stener the latter had loaned him money The Senator reflected on whether he should broach some such subtle solution of the situation as had occurred to him to his colleagues but he decided not Really Mollenhauer was too treacherous a man to work with on a thing of this kind It was a splendid chance but dangerous He had better go it alone For the present they should demand of Stener that he get Cowperwood to return the five hundred thousand dollars if he could If not Stener could be sacrificed for the benefit of the party if need be.\n",

      "The whole being explained many obliging things were said by the Miss Thorpes of their wish of being better acquainted with her of being considered as already friends through the friendship of their brothers etc which Catherine heard with pleasure and answered with all the pretty expressions she could command and as the first proof of amity she was soon invited to accept an arm of the eldest Miss Thorpe and take a turn with her about the room Catherine was delighted with this extension of her Bath acquaintance and almost forgot Mr Tilney while she talked to Miss Thorpe Friendship is certainly the finest balm for the pangs of disappointed love.\n",

      "As soon as divine service was over the Thorpes and Allens eagerly joined each other and after staying long enough in the pump-room to discover that the crowd was insupportable and that there was not a genteel face to be seen which everybody discovers every Sunday throughout the season they hastened away to the Crescent to breathe the fresh air of better company Here Catherine and Isabella arm in arm again tasted the sweets of friendship in an unreserved conversation they talked much and with much enjoyment but again was Catherine disappointed in her hope of reseeing her partner.\n",

      "Her daily expressions were no longer \"I wish we had some acquaintance in Bath \" They were changed into \"How glad I am we have met with Mrs Thorpe \" and she was as eager in promoting the intercourse of the two families as her young charge and Isabella themselves could be never satisfied with the day unless she spent the chief of it by the side of Mrs Thorpe in what they called conversation but in which there was scarcely ever any exchange of opinion and not often any resemblance of subject for Mrs Thorpe talked chiefly of her children and Mrs Allen of her gowns.\n",

      "The younger Miss Thorpes being also dancing Catherine was left to the mercy of Mrs Thorpe and Mrs Allen between whom she now remained She could not help being vexed at the non-appearance of Mr Thorpe for she not only longed to be dancing but was likewise aware that as the real dignity of her situation could not be known she was sharing with the scores of other young ladies still sitting down all the discredit of wanting a partner.\n",
      "From this state of humiliation she was roused at the end of ten minutes to a pleasanter feeling by seeing not Mr Thorpe but Mr Tilney within three yards of the place where they sat he seemed to be moving that way but he did not see her and therefore the smile and the blush which his sudden reappearance raised in Catherine passed away without sullying her heroic importance.\n",

      "\"Well tuck in \" said Fledge taking a big mouthful of grass Then he raised his head still chewing and with bits of grass sticking out on each side of his mouth like whiskers and said \"Come on you two Don't be shy There's plenty for us all \"But we can't eat grass \" said Digory \"H'm h'm \" said Fledge speaking with his mouth full \"Well - h'm - don't know quite what you'll do then Very good grass too Polly and Digory stared at one another in dismay.\n",
      "When Fledge had quite finished his own excellent supper he lay down The children came and sat one on each side of him leaning against his warm body and when he had spread a wing over each they were really quite snug As the bright young stars of that new world came out they talked over everything: how Digory had hoped to get something for his Mother and how instead of that he had been sent on this message.\n",
      "Fledge came lower and lower in wide circles The icy peaks rose up higher and higher above The air came up warmer and sweeter every moment so sweet that it almost brought the tears to your eyes Fledge was now gliding with his wings spread out motionless on each side and his hoofs pawing for the ground The steep green hill was rushing towards them A moment later he alighted on its slope a little awkwardly The children rolled off fell without hurting themselves on the warm fine grass and stood up panting a little.\n",
      "Digory was just turning to go back to the gates when he stopped to have one last look around He got a terrible shock He was not alone There only a few yards away from him stood the Witch She was just throwing away the core of an apple which she had eaten The juice was darker than you would expect and had made a horrid stain round her mouth Digory guessed at once that she must have climbed in over the wall And he began to see that there might be some sense in that last line about getting your heart's desire and getting despair along with it For the Witch looked stronger and prouder than ever and even in a way triumphant but her face was deadly white white as salt.\n",
      "WELL done \" said Aslan in a voice that made the earth shake Then Digory knew that all the Narnians had heard those words and that the story of them would be handed down from father to son in that new world for hundreds of years and perhaps forever But he was in no danger of feeling conceited for he didn't think about it at all now that he was face to face with Aslan This time he found he could look straight into the Lion's eyes He had forgotten his troubles and felt absolutely content.\n",
      "And he was sure now that her face looked a little different He bent down and kissed her very softly and stole out of the room with a beating heart taking the core of the apple with him For the rest of that day whenever he looked at the things about him and saw how ordinary and unmagical they were he hardly dared to hope but when he remembered the face of Aslan he did hope.\n",
      "In Narnia the Beasts lived in great peace and joy and neither the Witch nor any other enemy came to trouble that pleasant land for many hundred years King Frank and Queen Helen and their children lived happily in Narnia and their second son became King of Archenland The boys married nymphs and the girls married woodgods and river-gods.\n",
      "It was of course the Lion's voice The children had long felt sure that he could speak: yet it was a lovely and terrible shock when he did.\n",

      "Jo happened to suit Aunt March who was lame and needed an active person to wait upon her The childless old lady had offered to adopt one of the girls when the troubles came and was much offendedbecause her offer was declined Other friends told the Marches that they had lost all chance of being remembered in the rich old lady's will but the unworldly Marches only said\n",
      "The old lady wouldn't speak to them for a time but happening to meet Jo at a friend's something in her comical face and blunt manners struck the old lady's fancy and she proposed to take her for a companion This did not suit Jo at all but she accepted the place since nothing better appeared and to every one's surprise got on remarkably well with her irascible relative There was an occasional tempest and once Jo marched home declaring she couldn't bear it longer but Aunt March always cleared up quickly and sent for her to come back again with such urgency that she could not refuse for in her heart she rather liked the peppery old lady.\n",
      "Jo's ambition was to do something very splendid What it was she had no idea as yet but left it for time to tell her and meanwhile found her greatest affliction in the fact that she couldn't read run and ride as much as she liked A quick temper sharp tongue and restless spirit were always getting her into scrapes and her life was a series of ups and downs which were both comic and pathetic But the training she received at Aunt March's was just what she needed and the thought that she was doing something to support herself made her happy in spite of the perpetual \"Josy-phine\n",
      "One forlorn fragment of dollanity had belonged to Jo and having led a tempestuous life was left a wreck in the rag bag from which dreary poorhouse it was rescued by Beth and taken to her refuge Having no top to its head she tied on a neat little cap and as both arms and legs were gone she hid these deficiencies by folding it in a blanket and devoting her best bed to this chronic invalid If anyone had known the care lavished on that dolly I think it would have touched their hearts even while they laughed She brought it bits of bouquets she read to it took it out to breathe fresh air hidden under her coat she sang it lullabies and never went to bed without kissing its dirty face and whispering tenderly \"I hope you'll have a good night my poor dear.\"\n",
      "Beth had her troubles as well as the others and not being an angel but a very human little girl she often 'wept a little weep' as Jo said because she couldn't take music lessons and have a fine piano She loved music so dearly tried so hard to learn and practiced away so patiently at the jingling old instrument that it did seem as if someone (not to hint Aunt March) ought to help her.\n",
      "She got through her lessons as well as she could and managed to escape reprimands by being a model of deportment She was a great favorite with her mates being good-tempered and possessing the happy art of pleasing without effort Her little airs and graces were much admired so were her accomplishments for besides her drawing she could play twelve tunes crochet and read French without mispronouncing more than two-thirds of the words She had a plaintive way of saying \"When Papa was rich we did so-and-so \" which was very touching and her long words were considered 'perfectly elegant' by the girls.\n",
      "\"Being sensible girls they decided to try her advice and soon were surprised to see how well off they were One discovered that money couldn't keep shame and sorrow out of rich people's houses another that though she was poor she was a great deal happier with her youth health and good spirits than a certain fretful feeble old lady who couldn't enjoy her comforts a third that disagreeable as it was to help get dinner it was harder still to go begging for it and the fourth that even carnelian rings were not so valuable as good behavior.\n",

      "\"Yes till I hurt myself Sallie's friend Annie Moffat took a fancy to me and asked me to come and spend a week with her when Sallie does She is going in the spring when the opera comes and it will be perfectly splendid if Mother only lets me go \" answered Meg cheering up at the thought.\n",

      "Caspian missed his nurse very much and shed many tears and because he was so miserable he thought about the old stories of Narnia far more than before He dreamed of Dwarfs and Dryads every night and tried very hard to make the dogs and cats in the castle talk to him But the dogs only wagged their tails and the cats only purred.\n",
      "Of all his lessons with Doctor Cornelius the one that Caspian liked best was History Up till now except for Nurse's stories he had known nothing about the History of Narnia and he was very surprised to learn that the royal family were newcomers in the country.\n",
      "After that it was all nouns and verbs till lunchtime but I don't think Caspian learned much He was too excited He felt sure that Doctor Cornelius would not have said so much unless he meant to tell him more sooner or later.\n",
      "This didn't seem to have anything to do with Old Narnia which was what Caspian really wanted to hear about but getting up in the middle of the night is always interesting and he was moderately pleased When he went to bed that night he thought at first that he would not be able to sleep but he soon dropped off and it seemed only a few minutes before he felt someone gently shaking him.\n",
      "Caspian followed the Doctor through many passages and up several staircases and at last through a little door in a turret they came out upon the leads On one side were the battlements on the other a steep roof below them all shadowy and shimmery the castle gardens above them stars and moon Presently they came to another door which led into the great central tower of the whole castle: Doctor Cornelius unlocked it and they began to climb the dark winding stair of the tower Caspian was becoming excited he had never been allowed up this stair before.\n",
      "\"Oh I do wish we hadn't \" said Caspian \"And I am glad it was all true even if it is all over.\"\n",
      "\"Your Highness speaks as you have been taught \" said the Doctor \"But it is all lies There are no ghosts there That is a story invented by the Telmarines Your Kings are in deadly fear of the sea because they can never quite forget that in all stories Aslan comes from over the sea They don't want to go near it and they don't want anyone else to go near it So they have let great woods grow up to cut their people off from the coast.\n",
      "\"Hush \" said the Doctor \"Trust me and do exactly as I tell you Put on all your clothes you have a long journey before you Caspian was verysurprised but he had learned to have confidence in his Tutor and he began doing what he was told at once When he was dressed the Doctor said \"I have a wallet for you We must go into the next room and fill it with victuals from your Highness's supper table.\"\n",
      "Destrier was as excited as his master at this unusual journey and Caspian though tears had come into his eyes at saying good-bye to Doctor Cornelius felt brave and in a way happy to think that he was King Caspian riding to seek adventures with his sword on his left hip and Queen Susan's magic horn on his right But when day came with a sprinkle of rain and he looked about him and saw on every side unknown woods wild heaths and blue mountains he thought how large and strange the world was and felt frightened and small.\n",
      "When the great night came and his various strange subjects came stealing into the lawn by ones and twos and threes or by sixes and sevens - the moon then shining almost at her full - his heart swelled as he saw their numbers and heard their greetings All whom he had met were there: Bulgy Bears and Red Dwarfs and Black Dwarfs Moles and Badgers Hares and Hedgehogs and others whom he had not yet seen - five Satyrs as red as foxes the whole contingent of Talking Mice armed to the teeth and following a shrill trumpet some Owls the Old Raven of Ravenscaur.\n",
      "Everyone waited in silence while the three Dwarfs and two Badgers trotted stealthily across to the trees on the northwest side of the Lawn Then came a sharp dwarfish cry \"Stop Who goes there \" and a sudden spring A moment later a voice which Caspian knew well could he heard saying \"All right all right I'm unarmed Take my wrists if you like worthy Badgers but don't bite right through them I want to speak to the King Doctor Cornelius \" cried Caspian with joy and rushed forward to greet his old tutor Everyone else crowded round.\n",
      "It was heart-breaking work - all uphill again back over the ground they had already travelled When they felt that they really couldn't run any more even to save their lives they all dropped down in the damp moss beside a waterfall and behind a big boulder panting They were surprised to see how high they had already got.\n",
      "\"Oh dear oh dear \" said Lucy \"And I was so pleased at finding you again And I thought you'd let me stay And I thought you'd come roaring in and frighten all the enemies away - like last time And now everything is going to be horrid.\"\n",
      "\"Oh come on \" growled Edmund \"We've got to go There'll be no peace till we do He fully intended to back Lucy up but he was annoyed at losing his night's sleep and was making up for it by doing everything as sulkily as possible.\n",

      "\"I am sorry for Nikabrik \" said Caspian \"though he hated me from the first moment he saw me He had gone sour inside from long suffering and hating If we had won quickly he might have become a good Dwarf in the days of peace I don't know which of us killed him I'm glad of that.\"\n",
      "Inside they found Miraz unarmed and finishing his breakfast His face was flushed and there was a scowl on his brow here \" he growled flinging the parchment across the table to them \"See what a pack of nursery tales our jackanapes of a nephew has sent us.\"\n",
      "While they were doing this Edmund asked anxiously \"What do you think of him Peter \" \"Tough \" said Peter \"Very tough I have a chance if can keep him on the hop till his weight and short wind come against him - in this hot sun too To tell the truth I haven't much chance else Give my love to - to everyone at home Ed if he gets me Here he comes into the lists again\n",
      "They reached the river but there was no bridge It had disappeared since yesterday Then utter panic and horror fell upon them and they all surrendered.\n",
      "At the sight of Aslan the cheeks of the Telmarine soldiers became the colour of cold gravy their knees knocked together and many fell on their faces They had not believed in lions and this made their fear greater Even the Red Dwarfs who knew that he came as a friend stood with open mouths and could not speak.\n",
      "\"Oh dear \" said Cor \"I don't want to at all And Corin - I am most dreadfully sorry I never dreamed my turning up was going to chisel you out of your kingdom.\"\n",
      "\"Your royal Highness \" he said \"I am most truly sorry that things have come to this extremity Your Highness will bear witness that it was none of our doing And of course we shall be delighted to provide your Highness with shipping back to Tashbaan for the - er - treatment which Aslan has prescribed.\n",
      "Meanwhile at Anvard everyone was very glad that he had been disposed of before the real fun began which was a grand feast held that evening on the lawn before the castle with dozens of lanterns to help the moonlight And the wine flowed and tales were told and jokes were cracked and then silence was made and the King's poet with two fiddlers stepped out into the middle of the circle.\n",
      "\"Let the skies fall \" shrieked Rabadash \"Let the earth gape Let blood and fire obliterate the world But be sure I will never desist till I have dragged to my palace by her hair the barbarian queen the daughter of dogs the -\" \"The hour has struck \" said Aslan: and Rabadash saw to his supreme horror that everyone had begun to laugh.\n",
      "\"Little lady \" he said \"we bid you very heartily welcome If my dear wife were still alive we could make you better cheer but could not do it with a better will And I am sorry that you have had misfortunes and been driven from your father's house which cannot but be a grief to you My son Cor has told me about your adventures together and all your valour.\"\n",
      "\"Well well \" grumbled the King \"We'll pass it over for this time And now -\" What came next surprised Shasta as much as anything that had ever happened to him in his life He found himself suddenly embraced inn bear-like hug by King Lune and kissed on both cheeks Then the King set him down again and said \"Stand here together boys and let all the court see you Hold up your heads Now gentlemen look on them both Has any man any doubts\n",
      "He shook his mane and sprang forward into a great gallop - a Unicorn's gallop which in our world would have carried him out of sight in a few moments But now a most strange thing happened Everyone else began to run and they found to their astonishment that they could keep up with him: not only the Dogs and the humans but even fat little Puzzle and short-legged Poggin the Dwarf The air flew in their faces as if they were driving fast in a car without a windscreen.\n",
      "But when I watched the Tarkaan's face and marked every word that he said to the Monkey then I changed my mind: for I saw that the Tarkaan did not believe in it himself And then I understood that he did not believe in Tash at all: for if he had how could he dare to mock him \"When I understood this a great rage fell upon me and I wondered that the true Tash did not strike down both the Monkey and the Tarkaan with fire from heaven.\n",
      "\"As soon as I had gone in at the door the first wonder was that I found myself in this great sunlight (as we all are now) though the inside of the hovel had looked dark from outside But I had no time to marvel at this for immediately I was forced to fight for my head against one of our own men.\n",

      "The National Guard who for two months had been carefully reconnoitering in the neighboring woods，shooting sometimes their own sentinels，and ready for a combat whenever a little wolf stirred in the thicket，had now returned to their firesides．Their arms，their uniforms，all the murderous accoutrements with which they had lately struck fear into the national heart for three leagues in every direction，had suddenly disappeared．\n",
      "The last French soldiers finally came across the Seine to reach the Audemer bridge through Saint-Sever and Bourg-Achard；and，marching behind，on foot，between two officers of ordnance，the General，in despair，unable to do anything with these incongruous tatters，himself lost in the breaking-up of a people accustomed to conquer and disastrously beaten，in spite of his legendary bravery．\n",
      "A profound calm，a frightful，silent expectancy had spread over the city．Many of the heavy citizens，emasculated by commerce，anxiously awaited the conquerors，trembling lest their roasting spits or kitchen knives be considered arms．\n",
      "Sometimes an inhabitant，intimidated by this silence，moved rapidly along next the walls．The agony of waiting made them wish the enemy would come．\n",
      "After some time，as soon as the first terror disappears，a new calm is established．In many families，the Prussian officer eats at the table．He is sometimes well bred and，through politeness，pities France，and speaks of his repugnance in taking part in this affair．One is grateful to him for this sentiment；then，one may be，some day or other，in need of his protection．\n",
      "One is grateful to him for this sentiment；then，one may be，some day or other，in need of his protection．By treat-ing him well，one has，perhaps，a less number of men to feed．\n",
      "His reputation as a sharper was so well established that one evening at the residence of the prefect，Mr Tournel，author of some fables and songs，of keen，satirical mind，a local celebrity，having proposed to some ladies，who seemed to be getting a little sleepy，that they make up a game of“Loiseau tricks，the joke traversed the rooms of the prefect，reached those of the town，and then，in the months to come，made many a face in the province expand with laughter．\n",
      "As soon as she was recognized，a whisper went around among the honest women，and the words“prostitute”and“public shame”were whispered so loud that she raised her head．Then she threw at her neighbors such a provoking，courageous look that a great silence reigned，and everybody looked down except Loiseau，who watched her with an exhilarated air．\n",
      "The gentlemen ran to the farms along the way for provisions，but they did not even find bread，for the defiant peasant had concealed his stores for fear of being pillaged by the soldiers who，having nothing to put between their teeth，took by force whatever they discovered．\n",
      "Everything goes in time of war，does it not，Madame？”And then casting a comprehensive glance around，he added：“In moments like this，one can but be pleased to find people who are obliging．\n",

      "Suddenly the young wife of the manufacturer gave forth such a sigh that all heads were turned in her direction；she was as white as the snow without；her eyes closed，her head drooped；she had lost consciousness Her husband，much excited，implored the help of everybody．Each lost his head completely，until the elder of the two sisters，holding the head of the sufferer，slipped Ball-of-Fat's cup between her lips and forced her to swallow a few drops of wine．\n",
      "The conversation was about the war，naturally．They related the horrible deeds of the Prussians， the brave acts of the French；and all of them，although running away，did homage to those who stayed behind．\n",

      "In his turn he spoke，in a doctrinal tone，with the emphasis of a proclamation such as we see pasted on the walls about town，and finished by a bit of eloquence whereby he gave that“scamp of a Badinguet”a good lashing．Then Ball-of-Fat was angry，for she was a Bona-partist．\n",
      "But the Countess and the manufacturer's wife，who had in their souls an unreasonable hatred for the people that favor a Republic，and the same instinctive tenderness that all women have for a decorative，despotic government，felt themselves drawn，in spite of them－selves，toward this prostitute so full of dignity，whose sentiments so strongly resembled their own．\n",

      "Although the diligence was not moving，no one offered to alight，fearing some one might be waiting to murder them as they stepped out．Then the conductor appeared，holding in his hand one of the lanterns which lighted the carriage to its depth，and showed the two rows of frightened faces，whose mouths were open and whose eyes were wide with surprise and fear．\n",
      "They wished to preserve their dignity，comprehending that in such meetings as these they represented in some degree their great country，and somewhat disgusted with the docility of her companions，the fat girl tried to show more pride than her neighbors，the honest women，and，as she felt that some one should set an example，she continued her attitude of resistance assumed at the beginning of the journey．\n",
      "Everybody agreed with him，asking，begging，be seeching her to go，and at last they convinced her that it was best；they all feared the complications that might result from disobedience．She finally said：“It is for you that I do this，you understand．”\n",
      "The man，rattling like a crackled locomotive，had too much trouble in breathing to talk while eating，but his wife was never silent．She told all her impressions at the arrival of the Prussians，what they did，what they said，reviling them because they cost her some money，and because she had two sons in the army．She addressed herself especially to the Countess，flattered by being able to talk with a lady of quality．\n",
      "Loiseau，leaving his place，went to speak with the innkeeper in a low tone of voice．The great man laughed，shook，and squeaked，his corpulence quivered with joy at the jokes of his neighbor，and he bought of him six cases of wine for spring，after the Prussians had gone．\n",
      "They found themselves in a square，with a church at one end，and some low houses on either side， where they perceived some Prussian soldiers．The first one they saw was paring potatoes．The second，further off，was cleaning the hairdresser's shop．Another，bearded to the eyes，was tending a troublesome brat，cradling it and trying to appease it；and the great peasant women，whose husbands were“away in the army，”indicated by signs to their obedient conquerors the work they wished to have done：cutting wood，cooking the soup，grinding the coffee，or what not．One of them even washed the linen of his hostess，an impotent old grandmother．The Count，astonished，asked questions of the beadle who came out of the rectory．\n",
      "Cornudet，indignant at the cordial relations between the conquerors，and the conquered，preferred to shut himself up in the inn．Loiseau had a joke for the occasion：“They will repeople the land．”\n",
      "Everybody staved in the kitchen and discussed the situation endlessly，imagining all sorts of unlikely things．Perhaps they would be retained as hostages but to what end or taken prisoners or rather a consider able ransom might be demanded．At this thought a panic prevailed．The richest were the most frightened，al－ready seeing themselves constrained to pay for their lives with sacks of gold poured into the hands of this insolent soldier．\n",
      "Then Ball-of-Fat was immediately surrounded，questioned，and solicited by all to disclose the mystery of his visit．She resisted，at first，but soon becoming exasperated，she said：“What does he want？You really want to know what he wants？He wants to sleep with me．”\n",
      "Even gaiety returned，so funny did the whole story seem to them at last．The Count found some of the jokes a little off color，but they were so well told that he was forced to smile．In his turn，Loiseau came out with some still boldertales，and yet nobody was wounded．\n",
      "As soon as they entered the house she went to her room and did not appear again．The disquiet was extreme．What were they to do？If she continued to resist，what an embarrassment！\n",
      "“Delightful！A very gentle nature，and well educated，besides；then she is an artist to the tips of her fingers，sings beautifully，and draws to perfection．”\n",
      "Ball-of－Fat，in the haste and distraction of her rising， had not thought of anything； and she looked at them exasperated，suffocating with rage，at all of them eating so placidly．A tumultuous anger swept over her at first，and she opened her mouth to cry out at them， to hurl at them a flood of injury which mounted to her lips；but she could hot speak，her exasperation strangled her．\n",

      "But my heart was beating with excitement as I walked down the road，because in my hand I carried the letter that my father had given me just before he died．‘Davie，’he had said，‘when I am dead，take this to the house of Shaws，near Cramond．That's where I came from，and that's where you must go．Put this letter into the hands of Ebenezer Balfour．’\n",
      "Now I began to ask people on the road for the house of Shaws．Their answers worried me a little．Some people seemed surprised，some afraid，and some angry，when I spoke the name of Ebenezer Balfour．I could not understand this，but it was too far to go back to Essendean that day， and I wanted to find the rest of the Balfour family very much .\n",

      "After supper he said suddenly，‘Davie，I've been thinking．I promised your father a bit of money for ye before ye were born．A promise is a promise—and so I'm going to give ye forty pounds！’ These last words seemed very painful to him．He added，in a kind of scream，‘Scots！’\n",
      "‘Oh man，are ye alive or a ghost？’he cried ‘Get me my medicine，Davie—it's for my heart．’I found the medicine bottle and gave him some．He soon began to look a little better． ‘Why did you lie to me？’I asked angrily．‘Why did you give me money？ And why did you try to kill me？ Answer me！’\n",
      "‘My uncle and I have to see the lawyer，sir，’I replied，‘so I'm afraid we may not have enough time．’\n",
      "After a while I realized that I must be somewhere inside the ship，which was moving very fast through the water．‘I've been kidnapped！’I thought angrily．It was clear that my uncle and the captain had planned it together．\n",
      "As he spoke，two sailors carried Ransome into the cabin His face was as white as a sheet，and he did not move．My blood ran cold when I saw him．\n",
      "But I could not forget poor Ransome．As the days passed，I became more and more worried．I knew that，when the ship arrived in the Carolinas，I would no longer be a free man，but a slave．I thought hard，but there did not seem to be any way of escaping．\n",
      "‘They're going to attack you，and murder you！’ I told him �What！’he cried，jumping up．‘Will ye stand with me，against them？’‘I will！ I'm no thief or murderer！’I replied bravely．‘Are ye for King George？’\n",
      "I could not understand why they did not come to help me．I continued shouting wildly，although I could no longer see them．And then，I lay down and cried for the second time．This time I wasn't sad，but angry，because I thought that they had left me to die alone in that terrible place．\n",
      "How stupid of me not to realize that it was possible to get to Mull，twice a day，at low tide！Now I felt very grateful to the boatmen for guessing my problem，and coming back to help me． I walked towards the smoke that I had seen so often from Earraid，and reached a long，low house built of stone．\n",
      "I listened with interest to everything that they told me．But I liked it best when I heard Alan described as a fine man and an honest Highlander．When I got out of the boat in Appin， I sat down among some trees to decide what to do next．\n",
      "He stopped us in the road，to give the killer a better chance to shoot Campbell！’Now I felt a new kind of fear． My life was in serious danger， although I had not done anything wrong．My mouth felt dry， and for a moment I could not move．\n",
      "We ran and ran， faster than I had ever run before， and my heart was beat ing wildly． Sometimes， to my surprise， Alan straightened his back and showed himself to the soldiers who were chasing us．\n",
      "Man， I'm surprised at ye，’ said Alan．‘Do ye not know that if a Campbell is killed， the accused has to go to court in Inveraray， in the heart of Campbell country？ When the Campbell lawyers have finished with ye，ye'll be dead！’This frightened me a little．‘ All right， Alan，’ I said，‘ I'll go with you．’\n",
      "But when I woke up， several hours later， the valley was full of redcoats， and Alan was looking worried again， ‘If they go up the sides of the mountains，they'll see us，’he said．‘We'll just have to stay here and hope they don't， When it's dark，we'll try to get past them．’\n",
      "But when I woke up again， on the third day，I felt much better， although not very strong． I noticed that Alan was looking very ashamed， and I realized at once what had hap pened．‘David，’ he said miserably，‘I've lost all our money at cards， yours as well as mine．’‘No，no，ye haven't lost it！cried Cluny．\n",
      "He was worried about my health， and offered me a hand when we crossed a river or climbed a hill．But after two or three days，when he realized that I was still angry with him， he too became angry，and laughed at me when I fell， or seemed tired．\n",
      "Soon I arrived in Queensferry．When I saw people looking strangely at me，and realized how dirty my clothes were， I be gan to feel afraid． Would Mr Rankeillor want to talk to me？How could I prove who I was？ I had no papers with me． I was too ashamed to ask any of the townspeople for help，so I walked up and down，not knowing what to do．\n",

      "Well，the two bumped into each other and thechild fell down．Then a terrible thing happened．The mancalmly walked all over the child's body with his heavy boots，and left her screaming on the ground．It was an inhuman thingto do．\n",
      "‘He's not easy to describe， although I remember him perfectly．He's a strange-looking man．He's short，but has astrong， heavy body．There's something wrong with his appearance，something ugly and unpleasing—no，something hateful．I disliked him at once．’\n",

      "‘ He shookhis stick at the old man，who stepped back in surprise． Then he hit the old man violently with the stick and knocked him to the ground． He beat the helpless body again and again． I could hear the bones breaking… It was so terrible that I began to feel ill．Then everything went black and I don't remember anymore．’\n",
      "Sadly， he never saw me He was much older than my mother when they married， and died six months before I was born．My father's death made my beautiful young mother very unhappy， and she knew she would find life extremely difficult with a new baby and no husband.\n",
      "My mother was sitting by the fire， feeling very lonely and unhappy， and crying a little Suddenly a stern， strange-looking face appeared at the window ‘Open the door！’ordered the sternfaced lady． My mother was shocked，but obeyed at once． ‘You must be David Copper field's wife，’said the lady as she entered．\n",
      "This made my poor mother feel worse than ever �I know I wasn't very sensible—about money—or cooking—or things like that！’ she sobbed �But we loved each other—and he was helping me to learn—and then he died！Oh！Oh！’And she fell back in her chair， completely unconscious．\n",
      "But I knew that Peggotty did not like him． A few months later Peggotty told me that my mother was going to have a short holiday with some friends Meanwhile Peggotty and I would go to stay with her brother Daniel in Yarmouth，on the east coast， for two weeks．I was very excited when we climbed into the cart， although it was sad saying goodbye to my mother．\n",
      "I spent a wonderfully happy two weeks there，playing all day on the beach with Emily，and sleeping in my own little bed on the ship I am sure I was in love with little Emily in my childish way， and I cried bitterly when we had to say goodbye at the end of the holiday． But on the way home to Blunderstone， Peggotty looked at me very worriedly.\n",
      "While we've been away， your dear mother—has married Mr Murdstone！He's your stepfather now！’ I was deeply shocked． I could not understand how my mother could have married that man．And when we arrived home， I could not help showing my mother how very miserable I was．\n",
      "And when we arrived home， I could not help showing my mother how very miserable I was． I went straight to my room and lay sobbing on my bed，which made my poor mother very unhappy too． As she sat beside me， holding my hand， Mr Murdstone suddenly came in．\n",
      "I was still very young，and I was very frightened of him． If he had said one kind word to me， perhaps I would have liked and trusted him，and my life would have been different Instead， I hated him for the influence he had over my dear mother，who wanted to be kind to me， but also wanted to please her new husband．\n",

      "But he did not listen to me In my bedroom，he held my arms and started hitting me with the stick I managed to get hold of his hand， and bit deep into it He cried out angrily，and began to hit me as hard as he could．Above the noise of my screams， I could hear my mother and Peggotty crying outside the door.\n",

      "‘Master David，my dear，’she whispered sobbing，‘they are going to send you away to boarding school！ Tomorrow！’ ‘Oh Peggotty！’ I cried �Then I won't see you and mother very often！’ ‘No， my love But don't forget， I'll take care of your mother\n",
      "The bag was full of Peggotty’ s special cakes， and in the purse were eight bright shilling coins Thinking of my mother and Peggotty made me start crying again，but just then the driver Mr Barkis began to talk to me\n",
      "It looked strangely deserted I was very surprised to find that none of the boys were there， and was told that they were all on holiday，and that I had been sent there during the holidays as a punishment for my wickedness.\n",
      "Although I was extremely lonely and unhappy at this time，I was not looking forward to meeting all the other boys I felt sure they would laugh at me and especially at the sign I was forced to wear But one day Mr Mell told me that the headmaster， Mr Creakle had returned and wanted to see me.\n",
      "‘Ye-es，that’ s very kind of you ’I said although I was a little worried that all my money would disappear When we went upstairs to bed， I realized that all my money had been spent， as eight shillings’ worth of food and drink was laid out on my bed in the moonlight\n",
      "When we were all too tired to stay awake， Steer forth got up to go �Goodnight，young Copperfield， ’ he said putting a hand on my head �I'll take care of you．’‘It’ s very kind of you，’ I replied gratefully �You haven’ t got a sister， have you？’he asked sleepily.\n",
      "However， my home even with the Murdstones there seemed a much pleasanter place than school，and I was glad when the Christmas holidays arrived， and I was allowed to return to Blunderstone I was a little surprised to find that my mother had a new baby， and I could see at once that she was not well.\n",
      "However， my home even with the Murdstones there seemed a much pleasanter place than school，and I was glad when the Christmas holidays arrived， and I was allowed to return to Blunderstone I was a little surprised to find that my mother had a new baby， and I could see at once that she was not well.\n",
      "My stepfather and his sister seemed to hate me even more than before， if that were possible， and they made my life quite miserable whenever they could In fact，I was almost pleased when it was time to return to school， and see Traddles and Steerforth again As the cart drove away， I remember my mother standing outside our house，with her baby in her arms smiling sadly at me.\n",
      "I knew the truth �Your mother is dead，’ she said I was already sobbing loudly and I felt I was an orphan，quite alone in the world Mrs Creakle packed my case herself，and sent me home on the coach for the funeral.\n",
      "So next morning Mr Barkis appeared at the door with his cart， and Peggotty's cases were put on it We climbed up and sat beside him Peggotty was naturally a little sad to leave her old home， where she had been so happy with my mother and me， and at first she cried a little But when Mr Barkis saw her drying her eyes and looking more cheerful， he too began to look happier， and he whispered to me ‘Barkis is willing！You told her that！’ Aloud he said to Peggotty，‘Are you comfortable？’\n",
      "You'll always be welcome to come and stay！’So when I returned to Blunderstone， Peggotty had become Mrs Barkis， and I was glad to think of her in her own house，with a husband to take care of her At home， my stepfather and his sister did not seem pleased to see me， and were clearly trying to find a way of getting rid of me.\n",
      "All the warehouse workers were coarse， rough people who were used to working in dirty conditions for long hours No words can describe the horror I felt， when I realized what my life was going to be like from now on I was deeply ashamed at having such a job and I was also afraid that I would forget everything I had learnt from my mother and my teachers.\n",

      "He stayed in prison for several weeks， and I visited him regularly．I was delighted to hear on one of my visits that he would soon be free， as his creditors had unwillingly accepted the fact that he had no way of paying his debts I gave the news to Mrs Micawber when I returned home\n",
      "I knew I would never see him， my case or my ten shillings again． I sat down on the pavement and cried Now I had lost everything I owned in the world， and had no money for the coach fare to Dover．In the end I decided I would have to walk there， and I started the long journey\n",
      "But one day my aunt suggested that I should go to boarding school in Canterbury．I was delighted，as I was eager to continue my studies，and Canterbury was very near my aunt's home in Dover．So the next day my aunt and I went to Can terbury，where I admired the beautiful old buildings in the an cient city centre．\n",
      "He stared at me for a moment．Then he cried，‘Good heavens！It's little Copperfield！’I was so delighted to see him that I held both his hands，saying，‘My dear Steer forth，you have no idea how pleased I am to see you again！’\n",
      "‘They've put you in number 44？I'll soon change that．’And when Steer forth complained to the manager，I was immediately given a large，airy，comfortable room on the first floor，next to his．That night as I fell asleep I thought happily of the next few days，which Steer forth and I were planning to spend together．\n",
      "When I knocked at the door，Peggotty opened it，and did not recognize me for a moment．I had continued to write to her regularly，but we had not seen each other for seven years，and I was no longer the small boy she remembered．But when she realized I was her Master David，she sobbed and sobbed with delight，holding me in her arms as she had always done．Soon she was calmer，and we talked about the events of the last few years．\n",
      "What a lovely girl！And what a coarse young man she's engaged to！’I was shocked by these unexpectedly cold words．But when I turned to him and saw him smiling，I replied warmly，‘Ah，Steerforth！You pretend to laugh at people who are poorer or less educated than yourself，but I've just seen you spend the whole evening with the Peggotty family，making them happy！\n",
      "When Mrs Micawber came in，she was also delighted to see me，and we talked for some time about the twins， and the other children，and her husband's business interests．But this conversation soon made Mr Micawber rather depressed．\n",
      "In a few moments they had both dried their eyes and looked quite cheerful again．I realized that the Micawbers had not changed at all，but this quick change of mood was rather a surprise for Traddles．\n",

      "\"Do not you want to know who has taken it \" cried his wife impatiently.\n",
      "\"You are over-scrupulous surely I dare say Mr Bingley will be very glad to see you and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.\"\n",
      "\"We are not in a way to know what Mr Bingley likes \" said her mother resentfully \"since we are not to visit.\"\n",
      "\"I do not believe Mrs Long will do any such thing She has two nieces of her own She is a selfish hypocritical woman and I have no opinion of her.\"\n",
      "Mrs Bennet deigned not to make any reply but unable to contain herself began scolding one of her daughters.\n",
      "\"I do not cough for my own amusement \" replied Kitty fretfully.\n",
      "\"I honour your circumspection A fortnight's acquaintance is certainly very little.\n",
      "\"What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation \" cried he.\n",
      "It is very unlucky but as I have actually paid the visit we cannot escape the acquaintance now The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished that of Mrs Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest though when the first tumult of joy was over she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while.\n",
      "I was sure you loved our girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance Well how pleased I am and it is such a good joke too that you should have gone this morning and never said a word about it till now.\"\n",
      "\"Now Kitty you may cough as much as you chuse \" said Mr Bennet and as he spoke he left the room fatigued with the raptures of his wife.\n",
      "He had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies of whose beauty he had heard much but he saw only the father.\n",
      "Mr Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation &c Mrs Bennet was quite disconcerted She could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshir.\n",
      "The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr Bingley and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity for he was discovered to be proud to be above his company and above being pleased and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding disagreeable countenance and being unworthy to be compared with his friend.\n",
      "Mr Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room he was lively and unreserved danced every dance was angry that the ball closed so early @and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield.\n",
      "His character was decided He was the proudest most disagreeable man in the world and every body hoped that he would never come there again Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs Bennet whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her daughters.\n",
      "\"Come Darcy \" said he \"I must have you dance I hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner You had much better dance.\"\n",
      "She told the story however with great spirit among her friends for she had a lively playful disposition which delighted in any thing ridiculous.\n",
      "\"Oh my dear \" continued Mrs Bennet \"I am quite delighted with him He is so excessively handsome and his sisters are charming women I never in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses I dare say the lace upon Mrs Hurst's gown --\"\n",
      "Here she was interrupted again Mr Bennet protested against any description of finery She was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject and related with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration the shocking rudeness of Mr Darcy.\n",
      "\"But I can assure you \" she added \"that Lizzy does not lose much by not suiting his fancy for he is a most disagreeable horrid man not at all worth pleasing So high and so conceited that there was no enduring him Ą˘\n",
      "He walked here and he walked there fancying himself so very great Not handsome enough to dance with I wish you had been there my dear to have given him one of your set downs I quite detest the man.\"\n",
      "When Jane and Elizabeth were alone the former who had been cautious in her praise of Mr Bingley before expressed to her sister how very much she admired him \"He is just what a young man ought to be \" said she \"sensible good humoured lively and I never saw such happy manners -- so much ease with such perfect good breeding\n",
      "Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in Meryton where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the King during his mayoralty The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly.\n",
      "\"I beg you would not put it into Lizzy's head to be vexed by his ill-treatment for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him Mrs Long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips.\"\n",
      "\"Aye -- because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield and he could not help answering her -- but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to.\"\n",
      "The visit was returned in due form Miss Bennet's pleasing manners grew on the good will of Mrs Hurst and Miss BingleyĄŁ\n",
      "By Jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body hardly excepting even her sister and could not like them though their kindness to Jane such as it was had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration.\n",
      "Of this she was perfectly unaware -- to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with.\n",
      "\"You are a very strange creature by way of a friend -- always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body -- If my vanity had taken a musical turn you would have been invaluable but as it is I would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers.\"\n",
      "After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject Mr Bennet coolly observed \"From all that I can collect by your manner of talking you must be two of the silliest girls in the country I have suspected it some time but I am now convinced Catherine was disconcerted and made no answer but Lydia with perfect indifference continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day as he was going the next morning to London.\n",
      "\"I am astonished my dear \" said Mrs Bennet \"that you should be so ready to think your own children silly If I wished to think slightingly of any body's children it should not be of my own however.\"\n",
      "He might have to stay with his married daughter until he picks up another job yet he is suffused with a sense of pleasure because Jack Twist was in his dream.\n",
      "Got the dogs your sleep there Last summer had goddamn near twenty-five percent loss I don't want that again YOU \" he said to Ennis.\n",
      "Sir enough with his curly hair and quick laugh but for a small man he carried some weight in the haunch and his smile disclosed buckteeth not pronounced enough to let him eat popcorn out of the neck of a jug but noticeable He was infatuated with the rodeo life and fastened his belt with a minor bull-riding buckle but his boots were worn to the quick holed beyond repair and he was crazy to be somewhere anywhere else than Lightning Flat.\n",
      "They got the big tent up on the Forest Service's platform the kitchen and grub boxes secured Both slept in camp that first night Jack already bitching about Joe Aguirre's sleep-with-the-sheep-and-no-fire order though he saddled the bay mare in the dark morning without saying much.\n",
      "\"I'm commutin four hours a day \" he said morosely \"Come in for breakfast go back to the sheep evenin get em bedded down come in for supper go back to the sheep spend half the night jumpin up and checkin for coyotes.\n",
      "\"That ain't the point Point is we both should be in this camp And that goddamn pup tent smells like cat piss or worse.\"\n",
      "They had a high-time supper by the fire a can of beans each fried potatoes and a quart of whiskey on shares sat with their backs against a log boot soles and copper jeans rivets hot swapping the bottle while the lavender sky emptied of color and the chill air drained down drinking smoking cigarettes getting up every now and then to piss firelight throwing a sparkle in the arched stream tossing sticks on the fire to keep the talk going talking horses and rodeo roughstock events wrecks and injuries sustained the submarine Thresher lost two months earlier with all hands and how it must have been in the last doomed minutes dogs each had owned and known the draft Jack's home ranch where his father and mother held on Ennis's family place folded years ago after his folks died the older brother in Signal and a married sister in Casper.\n",
      "They were respectful of each other's opinions each glad to have a companion where none had been expected Ennis riding against the wind back to the sheep in the treacherous drunken light thought he'd never had such a good time felt he could paw the white out of the moon.\n",
      "They were respectful of each other's opinions each glad to have a companion where none had been expected Ennis riding against the wind back to the sheep in the treacherous drunken light thought he'd never had such a good time felt he could paw the white out of the moon.\n",
      "\"Jesus Christ quit hammerin and get over here Bedroll's big enough \" said Jack in an irritable sleep-clogged voice It was big enough warm enough and in a little while they deepened their intimacy considerably.\n",
      "Even when the numbers were right Ennis knew the sheep were mixed In a disquieting way everything seemed mixed.\n",
      "Joe Aguirre paid them said little He had looked at the milling sheep with a sour expression said \"Some a these never went up there with you The count was not what he'd hoped for either Ranch stiffs never did much of a job.\n",
      "When the Hi-Top folded they moved to a small apartment in Riverton up over a laundry Ennis got on the highway crew tolerating it but working weekends at the Rafter B in exchange for keeping his horses out there The second girl was born and Alma wanted to stay in town near the clinic because the child had an asthmatic wheeze.\n",
      "\"I guess \" said Ennis slipping his hand up her blouse sleeve and stirring the silky armpit hair then easing her down fingers moving up her ribs to the jelly breast over the round belly and knee and up into the wet gap all the way to the north pole or the equator depending which way you thought you were sailing working at it until she shuddered and bucked against his hand and he rolled her over did quickly what she hated They stayed in the little apartment which he favored because it could be left at any time.\n",
      "Late in the afternoon thunder growling that same old green pickup rolled in and he saw Jack get out of the truck beat-up Resistol tilted back A hot jolt scalded Ennis and he was out on the landing pulling the door closed behind him Jack took the stairs two and two.\n",
      "Late in the afternoon thunder growling that same old green pickup rolled in and he saw Jack get out of the truck beat-up Resistol tilted back A hot jolt scalded Ennis and he was out on the landing pulling the door closed behind him Jack took the stairs two and two They seized each other by the shoulders hugged mightily squeezing the breath out of each other saying son of a bitch son of a bitch then and easily as the right key turns the lock tumblers their mouths came together and hard Jack's big teeth bringing blood his hat falling to the floor stubble rasping wet saliva welling and the door opening and Alma looking out for a few seconds at Ennis's straining shoulders and shutting the door again and still they clinched pressing chest and groin and thigh and leg together treading on each other's toes until they pulled apart to breathe and Ennis not big on endearments said what he said to his horses and daughters little darlin.\n",
      "\"I got a boy \" said Jack \"Eight months old Tell you what I married a cute little old Texas girl down in Childress -- Lureen From the vibration of the floorboard on which they both stood Ennis could feel how hard Jack was shaking.\n",
      "\"I didn't know where in the hell you was \" said Ennis \"Four years I about give up on you I figured you was sore about that punch.\"\n",
      "Got this farm machinery business Course he don't let her have none a the money and he hates my fuckin guts so it's a hard go now but one a these days -- \"\n",
      "We do that in the wrong place we'll be dead There's no reins on this one It scares the piss out a me.\"\n",
      "He went on \"Yeah that little punch a yours surprised me I never figured you to throw a dirty punch.\"\n",
      "Dad got tired a me come bawlin in the house and when I was about six he set me down and says Ennis you got a problem and you got a fix it or it's gonna be with you until you're ninety and K 's ninety-three.\n",
      "Her resentment opened out a little every year: the embrace she had glimpsed Ennis's fishing trips once or twice a year with Jack Twist and never a vacation with her and the girls.\n",
      "Ennis went back to ranch work hired on here and there not getting much ahead but glad enough to be around stock again free to drop things quit if he had to and go into the mountains at short notice.\n",
      "What Jack remembered and craved in a way he could neither help nor understand was the time that distant summer on Brokeback when Ennis had come up behind him and pulled him close the silent embrace satisfying some shared and sexless hunger.\n",
      "The huge sadness of the northern plains rolled down on him He didn't know which way it was the tire iron or a real accident blood choking down Jack's throat and nobody to turn him over Under the wind drone he heard steel slamming off bone the hollow chatter of a settling tire rim.\n",
      "He had been about three or four he said always late getting to the toilet struggling with buttons the seat the height of the thing and often as not left the surroundings sprinkled down The old man blew up about it and this one time worked into a crazy rage.\n",
      "Around that time Jack began to appear in his dreams Jack as he had first seen him curly-headed and smiling and bucktoothed talking about getting up off his pockets and into the control zone but the can of beans with the spoon handle jutting out and balanced on the log was there as well in a cartoon shape and lurid colors that gave the dreams a flavor of comic obscenity The spoon handle was the kind that could be used as a tire iron And he would wake sometimes in grief sometimes with the old sense of joy and release the pillow sometimes wet sometimes the sheets.\n",

      "Sitting at Prim's knees guarding her is the world's ugliestcat Mashed-in nose half of one ear missing eyes the color of rotting squash Prim named him Buttercup insisting that his muddy yellow coat matched the bright flower I le hates me Or at least distrusts me Even though it was years ago I think he still remembers how I tried to drown him in a bucket when Prim brought him home.\n",
      "Scrawny kitten belly swollen with worms crawling with fleas The last thing I needed was another mouth to feed But Prim begged so hard cried even I had to let him stay It turned out okay My mother got rid ofthe vermin and he's a born mouser Even catches the occasional rat Sometimes when I clean a kill I feed Buttercup the entrails He has stopped hissing at me.\n",
      "Our house is almost at the edge of the Seam I only have topass a few gates to reach the scruffy field called the Meadow Separating the Meadow from the woods in fact enclosing all of District 12 is a high chain-link fence topped with barbedwire loops In theory it's supposed to be electrified twentyfour hours a day as a deterrent to the predators that live in the woods ！ packs of wild dogs lone cougars bears ！ that used to threaten our streets But since we're lucky to get two orthree hours of electricity in the evenings it's usually safe to touch Even so I always take a moment to listen carefully for the hum that means the fence is live Right now it's silent as a stone Concealed by a clump of bushes I flatten out on my belly and slide under a two-foot stretch that's been loose for years There are several other weak spots in the fence but this one is so close to home I almost always enter the woods here.\n",
      "As soon as I'm in the trees I retrieve a bow and sheath of arrows from a hollow log Electrified or not the fence  has been successful at keeping the flesh-eaters out of District 12 Inside the woods they roam freely and there are added concerns like venomous snakes rabid animals and no real paths to follow But there's also food if you know how to find it My father knew and he taught me some before he was blown to bits in a mine explosion There was nothing even to bury I was eleven then Five years later I still wake up screaming for him to run.\n",
      "Even though trespassing in the woods is illegal and poach-ing carries the severest of penalties more people would risk it if they had weapons But most are not bold enough to venture out with just a knife My bow is a rarity crafted by my father along with a few others that I keep well hidden in the woods carefully wrapped in waterproof covers.\n",
      "When I was younger I scared my mother to death the things I would blurt out about District 12 about the people who rule our country Panem from the far-off city called the Capitol Eventually I undxerstood this would only lead us to more trouble.\n",
      "In the woods waits the only person with whom I can bemyself Gale I can feel the muscles in my face relaxing my pace quickening as I climb the hills to our place a rock ledge overlooking a valley A thicket of berry bushes protects it from unwanted eyes The sight of him waiting there brings on a smile Gale says I never smile except in the woods.\n",

      "\"Hey Catnip \" says Gale My real name is Katniss but when I first told him I had barely whispered it So he thought I'd said Catnip Then when this crazy lynx started following me around the woods looking for handouts it became his official nickname for me I finally had to kill the lynx because he scared off game I almost regretted it because he wasn't bad company But I got a decent price for his pelt.\n",
      "\"Look what I shot \" Gale holds up a loaf of bread with an arrow stuck in it and I laugh It's real bakery bread not the flat dense loaves we make from our grain rations I take it in my hands pull out the arrow and hold the puncture in the crust to my nose inhaling the fragrance that makes my mouth flood with saliva Fine bread like this is for special occasions.\n",
      "Besides if he wants kids Gale won't have any trouble find-ing a wife He's good-looking he's strong enough to handle the work in the mines and he can hunt You can tell by the way the girls whisper about him when he walks by in school that they want himp It makes me jealous but not for the reason people would think Good hunting partners are hard to find.\n",
      "Tonight After the reaping everyone is supposed to celebrate And a lot of people do out of relief that their children have been spared for another year But at least two families will pull their shutters lock their doors and try to figure out how they will survive the painful weeks to come.\n",
      "Gale knows his anger at Madge is misdirected Onotherdays deep in the woods I've listened to him rant about how the tesserae are just another tool to cause misery in our district A way to plant hatred between the starving workers of the Seam and those who can generally count on supper andthereby ensure we will never trust one another \"It's to the Capitol's advantage to have us divided among ourselves \" he might say if there were no ears to hear but mine If it wasn't reaping day If a girl with a gold pin and no tesserae had not made what I'm sure she thought was a harmless comment.\n",
      "\"And nothing like myself \" I say I hug her because I know these next few hours will be terrible for her Her first reaping She's about as safe as you can get since she's only entered once I wouldn't let her take out any tesserae But she's worried about me That the unthinkable might happen.\n",
      "I protect Prim in every way I can but I'm powerless againstthe reaping The anguish I always feel when she's in pain wells up in my chest and threatens to register on my (ace I notice her blouse has pulled out of her skirt in the back again and force myself to stay calm \"Tuck your tail in little duck \" I say smoothing the blouse back in place.\n",
      "Prim giggles and gives me a small \"Quack Quack yourself \" I say with a light laugh The kind only Prim can draw out of me \"Come on let's eat \" I say and plant a quick kiss on the top of her head.\n",
      "It's too bad really that they hold the reaping in the square！ one of the few places in District 12 that can be pleasant The square's surrounded by shops and on public market days especially if there's good weather it has a holiday feel to it But today despite the bright banners hanging on the buildings there's an air of grimness The camera crews perched like buzzards on rooftops only add to the effect.\n",
      "The space gets tighter more claustrophobic as people ar-rive The square's quite large but not enough to hold District 12's population of about eight thousand Latecomers are directed to the adjacent streets where they can watch the event on screens as it's televised live by the state.\n",
      "Through the crowd I spot Gale looking back at me with a ghost of a smile As reapings go this one at least has a slight entertainment factor But suddenly I am thinking of Gale and his forty-two names in that big glass ball and how the oddsare not in his favor Not compared to a lot of the boys And maybe he's thinking the same thing about me because his face darkens and he turns away \"But there are still thousands of slips \" I wish I could whisper to him.\n",
      "It's time for the drawing Effie Trinket says as she always does \"Ladies first \" and crosses to the glass ball with the girls' names She reaches in digs her hand deep into the ball and pulls out a slip of paper The crowd draws in a collective breath and then you can hear a pin drop and I'm feeling nauseous and so desperately hoping that it's not me that it's not me that it's not me.\n",
      "That's how I feel now trying to remember how to breathe unable to speak totally stunned as the name bounces around the inside of my skull Someone is gripping my arm a boy from the Seam and I think maybe I started to fall and he caught me.\n",
      "There must have been some mistake This can't be happening Prim was one slip of paper in thousands Her chances of being chosen so remote that I'd not even bothered to worry about her Hadn't I done everything Taken the tesserae refused to let her do the same One slip One slip in thousands The odds had been entirely in her favor But it hadn't mattered.\n",
      "Somewhere far away I can hear the crowd murmuring un-happily as they always do when a twelve-year-old gets chosen because no one thinks this is fair And then I see her the blood drained from her face hands clenched in fists at her sides walking with stiff small steps up toward the stage passingme and I see the back of her blouse has become untucked and hangs out over her skirt It's this detail the untucked blouse forming a ducktail that brings me back to myself.\n",

      "\"Lovely \" says Effie Trinket \"But I believe there's a smallmatter of introducing the reaping winner and then asking for volunteers and if one does come forth then we um she trails off unsure herself.\n",
      "\"Well bravo \" gushes Effie Trinket \"That's the spirit of theGames \" She's pleased to finally have a district with a little action going on in it \"What's your name \"I swallow hard \"Katniss Everdeen \" I say.\n",
      "\"Look at her Look at this one \" he hollers throwing an arm around my shoulders He's surprisingly strong for such a wreck \"I like her \" His breath reeks of liquor and it's been a long time since he's bathed \"Lots of \" He can't think of the word for a while \"Spunk \" he says triumphantly \"More than you \" he releases me and starts for the front of the stage \"More than you \" he shouts pointing directly into a camera he addressing the audience or is he so drunk he might actually be taunting the Capitol I'll never know because just ashe's opening his mouth to continue Haymitch plummets off the stage and knocks himself unconscious 's disgusting but I'm grateful.\n",
      "Haymitch is whisked away on a stretcher and Effie Trinketis trying to get the ball rolling again \"What an exciting day \" she warbles as she attempts to straighten her wig which has listed severely to the right \"But more excitement to come It's time to choose our boy tribute \" Clearly hoping to contain her tenuous hair situation she plants one hand on her head as she crosses to the ball that contains the boys' names and grabs the first slip she encounters She zips back to the podium and I don't even have time to wish for Gale's safety when she's reading the name \"Peeta Mellark eeta Mellark\n",
      "It was during the worst time My father had been killed inthe mine accident three months earlier in the bitterest January anyone could remember The numbness of his loss had passed and the pain would hit me out of nowhere doubling me over racking my body with sobs Where are you I would cry out in my mind Where have you gone Of course there was never any answer.\n",

      "I was terrified I suppose now that my mother was lockedin some dark world of sadness but at the time all I knew was that I had lost not only a father but a mother as well At eleven years old with Prim just seven I took over as head of the family There was no choice I bought our food at the market and cooked it as best I could and tried to keep Prim and myself looking presentable.\n",
      "I couldn't go home Because at home was my mother withher dead eyes and my little sister with her hollow cheeks and cracked lips I couldn't walk into that room with the smokyfire from the damp branches I had scavenged at the edge of the woods after the coal had run out my bands empty of any hope.\n",
      "All forms of stealing are forbidden in District 12 Punishable by death But it crossed my mind that there might be something in the trash bins and those were fair game Perhaps a bone at the butcher's or rotted vegetables at the grocer's something no one but my family was desperate enough to eat Unfortunately the bins had just been emptied.\n",
      "When I passed the baker's the smell of fresh bread was sooverwhelming I felt dizzy The ovens were in the back and a golden glow spilled out the open kitchen door I stood mesmerized by the heat and the luscious scent until the rain interfered running its icy fingers down my back forcing me back to life I lifted the lid to the baker's trash bin and found it spotlessly heartlessly bare.\n",

      "Suddenly a voice was screaming at me and I looked up tosee the baker's wife telling me to move on and did I want her to call the Peacekeepers and how sick she was of having those brats from the Seam pawing through her trash The words were ugly and I had no defense As I carefully replaced the lid and backed away I noticed him a boy with blond hair peeringout from behind his mother's back I'd seen him at school.\n",
      "There was a clatter in the bakery and I heard the womanscreaming again and the sound of a blow and I vaguely wondered what was going on Feet sloshed toward me through the mud and I thought It's her She's coming to drive me away with a stick But it wasn't her It was the boy In his arms he carried two large loaves of bread that must have fallen into the fire because the crusts were scorched black.\n",
      "I don't bother suggesting Prim learn to hunt I tried to teach her a couple of times and it was disastrous The woods terrified her and whenever I shot something she'd get teary and talk about how we might be able to heal it if we got it home soon enough But she makes out well with her goat so I concentrate on that.\n",
      "My mother's eyes find the floor \"I know I won't I couldn'thelp what！\"\"Well you have to help it this time You can't clock out and leave Prim on her own There's no me now to keep you both alive It doesn't matter what happens Whatever you see on the screen You have to promise me you'll fight through it \" My voice has risen to a shout In it is all the anger all the fear I felt at her abandonment.\n",

      "Someone else enters the room and when I look up I'm surprised to see it's the baker Peeta Mellark's father I can't believe he's come to visit me After all I'll be trying to kill his son soon.\n",
      "Someone else enters the room and when I look up I'm surprised to see it's the baker Peeta Mellark's father I can't believe he's come to visit me After all I'll be trying to kill his son soon But we do know each other a bit and he knows Prim even better When she sells her goat cheeses at the Hob she puts two of them aside for him and he gives her a generous amount of bread in return We always wait to trade with him when his witch of a wife isn't around because he's so much nicer I feel certain he would never have hit his son the way she did over the burned bread But why has he come to see me\n",
      "My next guest is also unexpected Madge walks straight tome She is not weepy or evasive instead there's an urgency about her tone that surprises me \"They let you  wear  one thing from your district in the arena One thing to remind you of home Will you wear this \" She holds out the circular gold pin that was on her dress earlier I hadn't paid much attention to it before but now I see it's a small bird in flight.\n",
      "\"I don't even know if there'll be wood \" I say Another year they tossed everybody into a landscape of nothing but boulders and sand and scruffy bushes I particularly hated that year Many contestants were bitten by venomous snakes or went insane from thirst.\n",
      "The Peacekeepers are back too soon and Gale asks for more time but they're taking him away and I start to panic \"Don't let them starve \" I cry out clinging to his hand.\n",
      "I've been right not to cry The station is swarming with re-porters with their insectlike cameras trained directly on my face But I've had a lot of practice at wiping my face clean of emotions and I do this now I catch a glimpse of myself on the television screen on the wall that's airing my arrival live and feel gratified that I appear almost bored.\n",
      "\"At least you two have decent manners \" says Effie as we'refinishing the main course \"The pair last year ate everything with their hands like a couple of savages It completely upset my digestion he pair last year were two kids from the Seam who'd never not one day of their lives had enough to eat And when they did have food table manners were surely the last thing on their minds.\n",
      "The commentators are not sure what to say about the crowd's refusal to applaud The silent salute One says that District 12 has always been a bit backward but that local customs can be charming As if on cue Haymitch falls off the stage and they groan comically Peeta's name is drawn and he quietly takes his place We shake hands They cut to the anthem again and the pro-gram ends.\n",
      "Effie Trinket is disgruntled about the state her wig was in \"Your mentor has a lot to learn about presentation A lot about televised behavior eeta unexpectedly laughs ewasdrunk \"saysPeeta.\n",
      "The idea pulls me up short A kind Peeta Mellark is far more dangerous to me than an unkind one Kind people have a way of working their way inside me and rooting there And I can't let Peeta do this Not where we're going So I decide from this moment on to have as little as possible to do with the baker's son.\n",
      "The next day we were off school For a while I hung around the edges of the Meadow but finally I worked up the courage to go under the fence It was the first time I'd been  there alone without my father's weapons to protect me But I retrieved the small bow and arrows he'd made me from a hollow tree I probably didn't go more than twenty yards into the woods that day Most of the time I perched up in the branchesof an old oak hoping for game to come by After several hours I had the good luck to kill a rabbit.\n",
      "On May 8th I went to the Justice Building signed up for mytesserae and pulled home my first batch of grain and oil in Prim's toy wagon On the eighth of every month I was entitled to do the same I couldn't stop hunting and gathering of course The grain was not enough to live on and there wereother things to buy soap and milk and thread What we didn't absolutely have to eat I began to trade at the Hob It was frightening to enter that place without my father at my side but people had respected him and they accepted me Game was game after all no matter who'd shot it.\n",
      "Prim was thrilled to have her back but I kept watching waiting for her to disappear on us again I didn't trust her.\n",
      "Prim will undoubtedly sleep with my mother tonight The thought of that scruffy old Buttercup posting himself on the bed to watch over Prim comforts me If she cries he will nosehis way into her arms and curl up there until she calms down and falls asleep I'm so glad I didn't drown him.\n",
      "Imagining my home makes me ache with loneliness This day has been endless Could Gale and I have been eating blackberries only this morning It seems like a lifetime ago Like a long dream that deteriorated into a nightmare Maybe if I go to sleep I will wake up back in District 12 where I belong.\n",
      "\"Here's some advice Stay alive \" says Haymitch and then bursts out laughing I exchange a look with Peeta before I remember I'm having nothing more to do with him I'm surprised to see the hardness in his eyes He generally seems so mild.\n",
      "Peeta Mellark and I stand in silence as the train speeds along The tunnel goes on and on and I think of the tons of rock separating me from the sky and my chest tightens I hate being encased in stone this way It reminds me of the mines and my father trapped unable to reach sunlight buried forever in the darkness.\n",

      "The train finally begins to slow and suddenly bright lightfloods the compartment We can't help it Both Peeta and I run to the window to see what we've only seen on television the Capitol the ruling city of Panem The cameras haven't lied about its grandeur.\n",
      "The people begin to point at us eagerly as they recognize a tribute train rolling into the city I step away from the win-dow sickened by their excitement knowing they can't wait to watch us die But Peeta holds his ground actually waving and smiling at the gawking crowd.\n",
      "The three step back and admire their work \"Excellent You almost look like a human being now \" says Flavius and they all laugh.\n",
      "The door opens and a young man who must be Cinna en-ters I'm taken a back by how normal he looks Most of the stylists they interview on television are so dyed stenciled and surgically altered they're grotesque.\n",
      "Despite this morning's revelation about Peeta's character I'm actually relieved when he shows up dressed in an identical costume He should know about fire being a baker's son and all His stylist Portia and her team accompany him in and everyone is absolutely giddy with excitement over what a splash we'll make Except Cinna He just seems a bit weary as he accepts congratulations.\n",

      "Remember heads high Smiles They're going to love you I hear Cinna's voice in my head I lift my chin a bit higher put on my most winning smile and wave with my free hand I'm glad now I have Peeta to clutch for balance he is so steady solid as a rock As I gain confidence I actually blow a few kisses to the crowd The people of the Capitol are going nuts showering us with flowers shouting our names our first names which they have bothered to find on the program.\n",

      "\"It didn't show \" I tell him \"I'm sure no one noticed I'm sure they didn't notice anything but you You should wear flames more often \" he says \"They suit you And then he gives me a smile that seems so genuinely sweet with just the right touch of shyness that unexpected warmth rushes through me.\n",
      "But that's a dark and creaky thing that moves like a snail and smells of sour milk The walls of this elevator are made of crystal so that you can watch the people on the ground floor shrink to ants as you shoot up into the air It's exhilarating and I'm tempted to ask Effie Trinket if we can ride it again but somehow that seems childish.\n",
      "\"Everyone has their reservations naturally You being fromthe coal district But I said and this was very clever of me I said ｀Well if you put enough pressure on coal it turns to pearls '\" Effie beams at us so brilliantly that we have no choice but to respond enthusiastically to her cleverness even though it's wrong.\n",
      "\"Unfortunately I can't seal the sponsor deals for you Only Haymitch can do that \" says Effie grimly \"But don't worry I'll get him to the table at gunpoint if necessary lthough lacking in many departments Effie Trinket has acertain determination I have to admire.\n",
      "About halfway through my glass of wine my head starts feeling foggy so I change to water instead I don't like the feeling and hope it wears off soon How Haymitch can stand walking around like this full-time is a mystery.\n",
      "But even as I utter the words I feel my insides contracting with anxiety and guilt at the sight of her and while I can't pull it up I know some bad memory is associated with her The expression of terror that crosses her face only adds to my confusion and unease She shakes her head in denial quickly and hurries away from the table.\n",

      "Besides the idea of the girl with her maimed tongue frightens me She has reminded me why I'm here Not to model flashy costumes and eat delicacies But to die a bloody death while the crowds urge on my killer.\n",
      "Peeta takes off his jacket and wraps it around my shoulders I start to take a step back but then I let him deciding for a moment to accept both his jacket and his kindness A friend would do that right\n",
      "\"I'd leave here \" Peeta blurts out Then he looks around nervously It was loud enough to hear above the chimes He laughs \"I'd go home now if they let me But you have to admit the food's prime e's covered again If that's all you'd heard it would justsound like the words of a scared tribute not someone contemplating the unquestionable goodness of the Capitol.\n",
      "\"No we're not related \" I say Peeta nods unreadable \"Did he come to say good-bye to you \"\"Yes \" I say observing him carefully \"So did your father Hebrought me cookies eeta raises his eyebrows as if this is news But after watching him lie so smoothly I don't give this much weight.\n",
      "\"He knew your mother when they were kids \" says Peeta Another surprise But probably true \"Oh yes She grew up in town \" I say It seems impolite to say she never mentioned the baker except to compliment his bread.\n",
      "My slumbers are filled with disturbing dreams The face of the redheaded girl intertwines with gory images from earlier Hunger Games with my mother withdrawn and unreachable with Prim emaciated and terrified I bolt up screaming for my father to run as the mine explodes into a million deadly bits of light.\n",
      "When I'm dried and moisturized with lotion I find an outfithas been left for me at the front of the closet Tight black pants a long-sleeved burgundy tunic and leather shoes I put my hair in the single braid down my back This is the first time since the morning of the reaping that I resemble myself Nofancy hair and clothes no flaming capes Just me Looking like I could be headed for the woods It calms me.\n",
      "She has oftenest advised and helped me in my progress through college When I find my work particularly difficult and discouraging she writes me letters that make me feel glad and brave\n",

      "When they had laughed at Beth's story they asked their mother for one and after a moments thought she said soberly \"As I sat cutting out blue flannel jackets today at the rooms I felt very anxious about Father and thought how lonely and helpless we should be\n",
      "\"He spoke so cheerfully looked so sincere and seemed so glad to give his all that I was ashamed of myself I'd given one man and thought it too much while he gave four without grudging them I had all my girls to comfort me at home and his last son was waiting miles away to say good-by to him perhaps\n",
      "Mr Cutter was in a hurry and said 'No' rather crossly so she was going away looking hungry and sorry when  Mr Laurence hooked up a big fish with the crooked end of his cane and held it out to her She was so glad and surprised she took it right into her arms\n",

      "\"Back I went and made the Primroses as interesting as ever I could Once I was wicked enough to stop in a thrilling place and say meekly 'I'm afraid it tires you ma'am Shan't I stop now\n",
      "\"Oh bless you no But she let old Belsham rest and when I ran back after my gloves this afternoon there she was\n",
      "\"That reminds me \" said Meg \"that I've got something to tell It isn't funny like Jo's story but I thought about it a good deal as I came home At the Kings' today I found everybody in a flurry and one of the children said that her oldest brother had done something dreadful\n",

      "But the training she received at Aunt March's was just what she needed and the thought that she was doing something to support herself made her happy in spite of the perpetual \"Josy-phine\n",
      "This did not suit Jo at all but she accepted the place since nothing better appeared and to every one's surprise\n",
      "Poor Meg seldom complained but a sense of injustice made her feel bitter toward everyone sometimes\n",

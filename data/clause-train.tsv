That day Jobs walked into the lobby of the video game manufacturer Atari and told the personnel director	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	0
who was startled by his unkempt hair and attire	O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	0
that he wouldn't leave until they gave him a job.	O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	0
Jobs spent a few days in Munich	O O O O O O O	disgust	1
where he solved the interference problem	O O O O O O	disgust	1
but in the process he flummoxed the dark-suited German managers	O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1
They complained to Alcorn that he dressed and smelled like a bum and behaved rudely.	O B-EMO I-EMO O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	1
For his part	O O O	fear	2
Jobs was upset that the Germans kept trying to feed him meat and potatoes.	O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	2
He had a better time when he took the train to see the distributor in Turin	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	4
where the Italian pastas and his host's camaraderie were more simpatico	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	4
I had a wonderful couple of weeks in Turin	O O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO	happiness	4
which is this charged-up industrial town	O O O O O O	happiness	4
he recalled.	O O	happiness	4
Jobs by the hand	O O O O	fear	5
he led him out of the worshipful crowd and walked him up to a hill	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	5
where there was a well and a small pond	O O O O O O O O O	fear	5
we sit down and he pulls out this straight razor	O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	5
I'm thinking he's a nutcase and begin to worry	O O O O O O O O B-EMO	fear	5
Then he pulls out a bar of soap-I had long hair at the time-and he lathered up my hair and shaved my head.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	5
He told me he was deeply angry about the fact that he had been given up.	O O O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	6
Wozniak was thrilled when Jobs asked him to help and proposed splitting the fee	O B-EMO I-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	7
this was the most wonderful offer in my life	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	7
to actually design a game that people would use	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	7
he recalled.	O O	happiness	7
The Atari experience helped shape Jobs's approach to business and design	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	8
He appreciated the user-friendliness of Atari's insert-quarter-avoid-Klingons games	O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	8
that simplicity rubbed off on him and made him a very focused product person	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	8
said Ron Wayne.	O O O	happiness	8
I typed a few keys on the keyboard and I was shocked	O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO	surprise	9
The letters were displayed on the screen	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	9
t was Sunday	O O O	surprise	9
June 29	O O	surprise	9
1975	O	surprise	9
a milestone for the personal computer.	O O O O O O	surprise	9
His argument was that a great engineer would be remembered only if he teamed with a great marketer	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	11
and this required him to commit his designs to the partnership	O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	11
Jobs was so impressed and grateful that he offered Wayne a 10% stake in the new partnership	O O O O O B-EMO O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	11
turning him into a tie-breaker if Jobs and Wozniak disagreed over an issue.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	11
Jobs and Wozniak had no personal assets	O O O O O O O	fear	12
but Wayne (who worried about a global financial Armageddon) kept gold coins hidden in his mattress.	O O O B-EMO O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O	fear	12
Jobs and Wozniak had no personal assets	O O O O O O O	fear	13
but Wayne (who worried about a global financial Armageddon) kept gold coins hidden in his mattress	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	13
Because they had structured Apple as a simple partnership rather than a corporation	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	13
the partners would be personally liable for the debts	O O O O O O O O O	fear	13
and Wayne was afraid potential creditors would go after him.	O O B-EMO I-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	13
Clara Jobs didn't mind losing most of her house to piles of parts and houseguests	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	15
but she was frustrated by her son's increasingly quirky diets.	O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	15
What bothered him more was that Jobs knew nothing about marketing and seemed content to peddle his product to individual stores one by one.	O B-EMO O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	20
Like Markkula	O O	disgust	22
he hated dealing with the conflicts that Jobs engendered.	O B-EMO O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	22
A year after Lisa was born	O O O O O O	surprise	26
Jobs agreed to take a paternity test	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	26
Brennan's family was surprised	O O O B-EMO	surprise	26
but Jobs knew that Apple would soon be going public and he decided it was best to get the issue resolved.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	26
Atkinson and others had read some of the papers published by Xerox PARC	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	28
so they knew they were not getting a full description	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	28
Jobs phoned the head of the Xerox venture capital division to complain	O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO	disgust	28
a call immediately came back from corporate headquarters in Connecticut decreeing that Jobs and his group should be shown everything.	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	28
He was working so hard that one morning	O O O O O O O O	fear	30
in a daze	O O O	fear	30
he drove his Corvette into a parked truck and nearly killed himself	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	30
Jobs immediately drove to the hospital to see him	O O O O O O O O O	fear	30
We were pretty worried about you	O O O B-EMO I-EMO O	fear	30
he said when Atkinson regained consciousness.	O O O O O O	fear	30
Both Mike Scott and Mike Markkula were intent on bringing some order to Apple and became increasingly concerned about Jobs's disruptive behavior	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	33
So in September 1980	O O O O	fear	33
they secretly plotted a reorganization.	O O O O O	fear	33
What was really so difficult for me is that Steve never told me I wasn't eligible	O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	35
recalled Kottke.	O O	sadness	35
But when he got in to see him	O O O O O O O O	anger	36
Jobs was so cold that Kottke froze	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	36
I just got choked up and began to cry and just couldn't talk to him	O O O B-EMO I-EMO O O O O O O O O O O	anger	36
Kottke recalled	O O	anger	36
Our friendship was all gone	O O O O O	anger	36
It was so sad.	O O O O	anger	36
Jobs even tried to reengage Wozniak	O O O O O O	disgust	38
I resented the fact that he had not been doing much	O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	38
but then I thought	O O O O	disgust	38
hell	O	disgust	38
I wouldn't be here without his brilliance	O O O O O O O	disgust	38
Jobs later told me.	O O O O	disgust	38
One day Jobs came into the cubicle of Larry Kenyon	O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	41
an engineer who was working on the Macintosh operating system	O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	41
and complained that it was taking too long to boot up.	O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	41
He also admired the design of the Mercedes.	O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	42
He had just come up with a brilliant algorithm that could draw circles and ovals onscreen quickly	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	44
The math for making circles usually required calculating square roots	O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	44
which the 68000 microprocessor didn't support	O O O O O O	surprise	44
But Atkinson did a workaround based on the fact that the sum of a sequence of odd numbers produces a sequence of perfect squares (for example	O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O	surprise	44
1 + 3 = 4	O O O O O	surprise	44
1 + 3 + 5 = 9	O O O O O O O	surprise	44
etc	O	surprise	44
Hertzfeld recalled that when Atkinson fired up his demo	O O O O O O O O O	surprise	44
everyone was impressed except Jobs.	O O B-EMO O O	surprise	44
Atkinson had been left out of the publicity interviews for the Lisa launch	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	47
and he marched into Jobs's hotel room and threatened to quit	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	47
Jobs tried to minimize the slight	O O O O O O	anger	47
but Atkinson refused to be mollified	O O O O O O	anger	47
Jobs got annoyed.	O O B-EMO	anger	47
But by the time the Lisa was ready to ship in the spring of 1983	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	48
it was clear that the Twiggy was buggy	O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	48
Because the Lisa also came with a hard-disk drive	O O O O O O O O O	fear	48
this was not a complete disaster	O O O O O O	fear	48
But the Mac had no hard disk	O O O O O O O	fear	48
so it faced a crisis	O O O O O	fear	48
The Mac team was beginning to panic	O O O O O O B-EMO	fear	48
said Hertzfeld.	O O	fear	48
A few days later he drove to Apple's factory in San Jose to see the Twiggy being made	O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	49
More than half were rejected	O O O O O	anger	49
Jobs erupted	O B-EMO	anger	49
With his face flushed	O O O O	anger	49
he began shouting and sputtering about firing everyone who worked there.	O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O O O O O O	anger	49
He took them to visit a computer store	O O O O O O O O	surprise	50
where he was struck by how poorly the products were marketed.	O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	50
When he arrived at Apple headquarters	O O O O O O	surprise	51
Sculley was startled by the unassuming offices and casual atmosphere.	O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	51
The explanation that Sculley might buy a lot of Macintoshes for Pepsi sounded a little bit fishy to me	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	53
Hertzfeld recalled	O O	happiness	53
but he and Susan Kare created a screen of Pepsi caps and cans that danced around with the Apple logo	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	53
Hertzfeld was so excited he began waving his arms around during the demo	O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O O O	happiness	53
but Sculley seemed underwhelmed.	O O O O	happiness	53
To him	O O	anger	55
the marketing costs were like any other production cost and needed to be factored into the price	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	55
Jobs resisted furiously.	O B-EMO I-EMO	anger	55
So Jobs promised them	O O O O	anger	56
don't worry	O O	anger	56
I'm not going to let him get away with it	O O O O O O O O O O	anger	56
But in the end	O O O O	anger	56
Sculley prevailed	O O	anger	56
Even twenty-five years later Jobs seethed when recalling the decision: It's the main reason the Macintosh sales slowed and Microsoft got to dominate the market.	O O O O O B-EMO O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	56
Hertzfeld	O	happiness	57
who took great pride that they could achieve their functionality solely using software	O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	57
replied	O	happiness	57
We don't have any special hardware for it	O O O O O O O O	happiness	57
Gates insisted that it was necessary to have special hardware to move the cursor that way.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	57
Despite their mutual wariness	O O O O	happiness	58
both teams were excited by the prospect that Microsoft would create graphical software for the Macintosh that would take personal computing into a new realm	O O O B-EMO O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	58
and they went to dinner at a fancy restaurant to celebrate.	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	58
But this arrangement upset competing software makers	O O O B-EMO O O O	happiness	59
In addition	O O	happiness	59
it seemed that some of Microsoft's programs might be late	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	59
So Jobs invoked a provision in his deal with Microsoft and decided not to bundle its software	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	59
Microsoft would have to scramble to distribute its software as products sold directly to consumers.	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	59
As Jobs and his team began to work closely with Microsoft	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	60
they grew worried that it would copy Macintosh's graphical user interface.	O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	60
After Jobs talked about the just-in-time production schedules	O O O O O O O O	anger	62
she asked about overtime pay	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	62
He was annoyed	O O B-EMO	anger	62
so he described how automation helped him keep down labor costs	O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	62
a subject he knew would not delight her.	O O O O O O O O	anger	62
Is it hard work	O O O O	disgust	63
she asked	O O	disgust	63
@ How much vacation time do they get	O O O O O O O O	disgust	63
Jobs couldn't contain himself	O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO	disgust	63
bs replied	O O	disgust	63
I'm in a hurry	O O O O	disgust	63
##Amazingly	O	disgust	63
the officer didn't get mad.	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	63
When Jobs made his usual threat about cutting down on France's allocations if Gass��e didn't jack up sales projections	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	65
Gass��e got angry.	O B-EMO I-EMO	anger	65
I was furious because the Mac XL wasn't real	O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	66
said Hoffman	O O	anger	66
It was just to blow the excess Lisas out the door.	O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	66
The venture capitalist Don Valentine marveled at the change in the decade since that time.	O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	67
By early 1985 Burrell Smith was also ready to leave	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	69
He had worried that it would be hard to quit if Jobs tried to talk him out of it	O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	69
There he happened to see sketches that the firm had made for Wozniak's new remote control device	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	70
and he flew into a rage.	O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO	anger	70
Sculley's wife was surprised to see him back in the middle of the day	O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	73
I've failed	O O	surprise	73
he said to her forlornly.	O O O O O	surprise	73
His ire stoked by hearing from Markkula that Jobs had spent the previous evening trying to subvert him	O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	74
Sculley walked over to Jobs's office on Tuesday morning.	O O O O O O O O O	anger	74
He warned them that there were strict laws against sharing technology with the Soviets	O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	76
Jobs was annoyed.	O O B-EMO	anger	76
Lewin's university consortium had been a godsend to the Macintosh group	O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	77
but he had become frustrated after Jobs left and Bill Campbell had reorganized marketing in a way that reduced the role of direct sales to universities.	O O O O B-EMO O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	77
What particularly struck Nocera was Jobs's almost willful lack of tact.	O O B-EMO O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	79
In the spring of 1988 cash was running so short that he convened a meeting to decree deep spending cuts across the board	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	80
When it was over	O O O O	fear	80
Lasseter and his animation group were almost too afraid to ask Jobs about authorizing some extra money for another short.	O O O O O O O O B-EMO O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	80
Jobs had been reluctant to let Paul and Clara	O O O O O O O O O	anger	81
whom he considered his real parents	O O O O O O	anger	81
know about his search for his birth mother	O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	81
With a sensitivity that was unusual for him	O O O O O O O O	anger	81
and which showed the deep affection he felt for his parents	O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	81
he worried that they might be offended.	O O O O O O B-EMO	anger	81
Joanne was overcome with emotion when Jobs arrived at her Los Angeles house	O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	82
She knew he was famous and rich	O O O O O O O	happiness	82
but she wasn't exactly sure why.	O O O O O O	happiness	82
Jobs was thrilled to find that he had a sibling who was so similar to him.	O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	83
I don't hold anything against him��I'm happy to be alive	O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	84
But what bothers me most is that he didn't treat Mona well	O O B-EMO O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	84
He abandoned her.	O O O	disgust	84
Redse came from a troubled family	O O O O O O	sadness	85
and Jobs shared with her his own pain about being put up for adoption.	O O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	85
On occasion this could backfire	O O O O O	fear	86
such as when Jobs and Ive insisted on using a solid piece of brushed aluminum for the edge of the iPhone 4 even when the engineers worried that it would compromise the antenna	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	86
But usually the distinctiveness of its designs�for the iMac	O O O O O O O O O	fear	86
the iPod	O O	fear	86
the iPhone	O O	fear	86
and the iPad�would set Apple apart and lead to its triumphs in the years after Jobs returned.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	86
He was proud that his father never adopted a servile attitude or slick style that may have made him a better salesman.	O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	89

because he was one of my heroes	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	98
And I was also afraid that he   wouldn't be really smart anymore	O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CAU O	fear	98
that he'd be a caricature of himself	O O O O O O O	fear	98
like   happens to a lot of people	O O O O O O O O O	fear	98
But I was delighted	O O O O	fear	98

Bewkes told him.	O O O	happiness	102
They are scared to death	O O B-EMO O B-CAU	fear	103

He was given the command of another expedition which left England in April 1860	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	106

Lines of traffic are the worst tracks (there are no roads in the districts here referred to) for a traveller to go upon	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	110
not only because the hospitality of the people has been damped by frequent communication with travellers	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	110

with this exception	O O O	happiness	113
that as a slave he feels himself much degraded in the social scale of society	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	113

according to the Mohammedan creed the slaves ought to be freed	O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	114
In Arabia this would be the case	O O O O O O O	disgust	114

If you give him a gun and some ammunition to protect him in case of emergencies	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	115
he will promise to save it	O O O O O O	surprise	115

On the 17th	O O O	happiness	116

without a moment's delay I went off to the British Consulate to see my old friend Colonel Rigby	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	116
He was delighted to see us	O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU	happiness	116

in anticipation of our arrival	O O O O O	happiness	116
had prepared rooms for our reception	O O O O O O	happiness	116
that both Captain Grant and myself might enjoy his hospitality until arrangements could be made for our final start into the interior.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	116
To call on the Sultan	O O O O O	surprise	117

He received us in his usually affable manner	O O O O O O O O	surprise	117
made many trite remarks concerning our plans	O O O O O O O	surprise	117

Colonel Rigby	O O	happiness	118
who had at heart as much as anybody the success of the expedition	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	118

On my return to Zanzibar	O O O O O	happiness	119

embarking at noon	O O O	happiness	119

we lay-to that night at Tombat	O O O O O O	happiness	119

We had a brave crew of young negroes to pull us	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	120
but	O	fear	120
pull as they would	O O O O	fear	120
the current was so strong that we feared	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O B-EMO	fear	120

we should be drawn into the broad Indian Ocean	O O O O O O O O O	fear	120
so	O	fear	120
changing our line	O O O	fear	120
we bore into the little coralline island	O O O O O O O	fear	120
Maziwa	O	fear	120

They both knew Hindustani	O O O O	happiness	123
but while Rahan's services at sea had been short	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	123
Baraka had served nearly all his life with Englishmen--was the smartest and most intelligent negro I ever saw--was invaluable to Colonel Rigby as a detector of slave-traders	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O B-EMO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	123

that he said	O O O	happiness	123

that he did not know where he should be able to find another man to fill his post.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	123
wo taxes in five miles was a thing unheard of	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	124
and I heard no more about the matter	O O O O O O O O	fear	124
until Bombay in the evening told me how Sheikh Said	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	124
fearing awkward consequences	B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU	fear	124
had settled to give two dubuani	O O O O O O	fear	124
one being taken from his own store	O O O O O O O	fear	124
Lion's Claw also turned up again	O O O O O O	fear	124
getting his cloths of yesterday--one more being added from the Sheikh's stores--and he was then advised to go off quietly	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	124

At the advice of Musa	O O O O O	sadness	127
I sent Maula's son off at night to tell the old chief how sorry I was to find the Arabs so hot-headed I could not even effect an arrangement with them	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	127
It was a great pity	O O O O B-EMO	sadness	127
for Manua Sera was so much liked by the Wanyamuezi	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	127
they would	O O	sadness	127
had they been able	O O O O	sadness	127
have done anything to restore him.	O O O O O O	sadness	127
Next day the non-belligerent Arabs left in charge of the station	O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	128
headed by my old friends Abdulla and Mohinna	O O O O O O O O	sadness	128
came to pay their respects again	O O O O O O	sadness	128
recognising in me	O O O	sadness	128
as they said	O O O	sadness	128
"a ""personification of their sultan"	O O O O O	sadness	128
""" and therefore considering what they were doing only due to my rank"	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	128
They regretted with myself that Snay was so hot-headed	O B-EMO O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	128
for they themselves thought a treaty of peace would have been the best thing for them	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	128
for they were more than half-ruined already	O O O O O O O	sadness	128

Then	O	sadness	128
turning to geography	O O O	sadness	128
I told Abdulla all I had written and lectured in England concerning his stories about navigators on the N'yanza	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	128
which I explained must be the Nile	O O O O O O O	sadness	128

I now gave all my men presents for the severe trials they had experienced in the wilderness	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	129
forgetting	O	disgust	129

enlarging my zoological collection	O O O O	sadness	130

when the whole of Kaze was depressed by a sad scene of mourning and tears	O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	130
Some slaves came in that night--having made their way through the woods from Ugogo	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	130
avoiding the track to save themselves from detection-- and gave information that Snay	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	130

The Arabs	O O	sadness	131
after the first burst of their grief was over	O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO O	sadness	131
came to me again in a body	O O O O O O O	sadness	131
and begged me to assist them	O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	131
for they were utterly undone	O O O O O	sadness	131
Manua Sera prevented their direct communication with their detachment at Mdaburu	O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	131
and that again was cut off from their caravans at Kanyenye by the Mzanza people	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	131

Her old mistress	O O O	sadness	132

as she had succeeded her	O O O O O	sadness	132
the people of her country invited Singinya to marry her	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	132

At that moment Singinya was out in the field fighting his enemies	O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	132

Sheikh Said pressed me to go on with the journey as fast as possible	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	134

though he promised to follow me the very next day or die in the attempt	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	136
and he also said he would bring on the four men required by Suwarora	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	136
for I was fully satisfied in my mind that he would have marched with me then had he had the resolution to do so at all.	O O O O B-EMO O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	136
My patience was beginning to suffer again	O O O O O B-EMO O	sadness	138
for I could not help thinking that the chiefs of the place were preventing their village men going with me in order that my presence here might ward of the Watuta	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	138
so I called up the kirangozi	O O O O O O	sadness	138
"who had thirteen ""Watoto"	O O O O	sadness	138
""" as they are called"	O O O O O	sadness	138
or children of his own	O O O O O	sadness	138
wishing to go	O O O	sadness	138
and asked him if he knew why no other men could be got.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	138
My men had greatly amused him by firing their guns off and showing him the use of their sword-bayonets	O O O O B-EMO O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	139
I knew	O O	happiness	139
as a matter of course	O O O O O	happiness	139
that if I stopped any longer I should be teased for more cloths	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	139
and gave orders to my men to march the same instant	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	139
saying	O	happiness	139
if they did not--for I saw them hesitate--I would give the cows to the villagers	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	139
since I knew that was the thing that weighed on their minds.	O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	139
This provoked fresh squabbles	O O O O	sadness	140
The drums had beaten and the tax was settled	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	140
I could not pay more	O O O O O	sadness	140
The kirangozi	O O	sadness	140
however	O	sadness	140
said he would not move a peg unless I gave something more	O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	140
else he would be seized on his way back	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	140
"His ""children' all said the same"	O O O O O O	sadness	140
and as I thought Grant would only be worsted if I did not keep friends with the scoundrel	O O O O O O O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	140
I gave four yards more merikani	O O O O O O	sadness	140
and then went on my way.	O O O O O O	sadness	140
At length giving in	O O O O	fear	141
I entered Ruhe's boma	O O O O	fear	141
the poles of which were decked with the skulls of his enemies stuck upon them	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	141
Instead	O	fear	141
however	O	fear	141
of seeing him myself	O O O O	fear	141
as he feared my evil eye	O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	141
I conducted the arrangements for the hongo through Baraka	O O O O O O O O O	fear	141
in the same way as I did at M'yonga's	O O O O O O O O O	fear	141
directing that it should be limited to the small sum of one barsati and four yards kiniki.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	141
This was too provoking	O O O O	fear	142
The perpetual worry had given Baraka a fever	O O B-EMO I-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	142
and had made me feel quite sick	O O O O O O O	fear	142
so I said	O O O	fear	142
if he ever mentioned a gun or lucifers again	O O O O O O O O O	fear	142
I would fight the matter out with him	O O O O O O O O	fear	142
for I had not come there to be bullied	O O O O O O O O O	fear	142
He then gave way	O O O O	fear	142
and begged I would allow my men to fire a volley outside his boma	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	142
as the Watuta were living behind a small line of granitic hills flanking the west of his district	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	142
and he wished to show them what a powerful force he had got with him.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	142
I then told the Pig and Baraka to settle at once	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	143
They no sooner did so than the drums beat	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	143
and Makaka	O O	happiness	143
in the best humour possible	O O O B-EMO O	happiness	143
came over to say I had permission to go when I liked	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	143
but he hoped I would give him a gun and a box of lucifers	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	143
This was too provoking	O O O O	happiness	143
The perpetual worry had given Baraka a fever	O O O O O O O O	happiness	143
and had made me feel quite sick	O O O O O O O	happiness	143
so I said	O O O	happiness	143
if he ever mentioned a gun or lucifers again	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	143
I would fight the matter out with him	O O O O O O O O	happiness	143
for I had not come there to be bullied.	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	143
Whilst engaged in this operation	O O O O O	fear	144
Baraka	O	fear	144
accompanied by Wadimoyo (Heart's-stream)	O O O O	fear	144
another of my freeman	O O O O	fear	144
approached me in great consternation	O O O O O	fear	144
whispering to themselves	O O O	fear	144
They said they had some fearful news to communicate	O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO O O	fear	144
which	O	fear	144
when I heard it	O O O O	fear	144
they knew would deter our progress: it was of such great moment and magnitude	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O	fear	144
they thought they could not deliver it then.	O O O O O O O O	fear	144
Then Baraka said	O O O	anger	145
"""I have just heard from Makaka"	O O O O O O	anger	145
that a man who arrived from Usui only a few minutes ago has said Suwarora is so angry with the Arabs that he has detained one caravan of theirs in his country	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	145
and	O	anger	145
separating the whole of their men	O O O O O O	anger	145
has placed each of them in different bomas	O O O O O O O O	anger	145
with orders to his village officers that	O O O O O O O	anger	145
in case the Watuta came into his country	O O O O O O O O	anger	145
"without further ceremony they were to be all put to death."""	O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	145
This was a fearful drain on my store	O O O O O O O O	anger	146
but the Pig	O O O	anger	146
seeing my concern	O O O	anger	146
merely laughed at it	O O O O	anger	146
and said	O O	anger	146
"""Oh"	O	anger	146
these savage chiefs are all alike here	O O O O O O O	anger	146
you will have one of these taxes to pay every stage to Uyofu	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	146
and then the heavy work will begin	O O O O O O O	anger	146
for all these men	O O O O	anger	146
although they assume the dignity of chief to themselves	O O O O O O O O O	anger	146
are mere officers	O O O	anger	146
who have to pay tribute to Suwarora	O O O O O O O	anger	146
"and he would be angry if they were shortcoming."""	O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	146
These two slaves	O O O	fear	147
both of whom knew all the chiefs and languages up to and including Uganda	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	147
promised me faithfully they would go with Bombay on to Usui	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	147
and bring back porters in sufficient number for Grant and myself to go on together	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	147
They laughed at the stories I told them of the terror that had seized Baraka and all the Wanguana	O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	147
and told me	O O O	fear	147
as old Musa had often done before	O O O O O O O	fear	147
that those men	O O O	fear	147
especially Baraka	O O	fear	147
had from their first leaving Kaze made up their minds they would not enter Usui	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	147
or go anywhere very far north.	O O O O O O	fear	147
Then turning to the animals	O O O O O	anger	148
he roared over each one in turn as he examined them	O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	148
and called out their names	O O O O O	anger	148
My bull's-eye lantern he coveted so much	O O O O O O O	anger	148
I had to pretend exceeding anger to stop his further importunities	O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	148
He then began again begging for lucifers	O O O O O O O	anger	148
which charmed him so intensely I thought I should never get rid of him.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	148
whilst in the valley there were not only magnificent trees of extraordinary height	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	149
but also a surprising amount of the richest cultivation	O O O O O O O O O	disgust	149
amongst which the banana may be said to prevail	O O O O O O O O O	disgust	149
Notwithstanding this apparent richness in the land	O O O O O O O	disgust	149
the Wanyambo	O O	disgust	149
living in their small squalid huts	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	149
seem poor	O B-EMO	disgust	149
The tobacco they smoke is imported from the coffee-growing country of Uhaiya.	O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	149
Leaving the valley of Uthenga	O O O O O	happiness	151
we rose over the spur of N'yamwara	O O O O O O O	happiness	151
where we found we had attained the delightful altitude of 5000 odd feet	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	151
@ Oh	O O	happiness	151
how we enjoyed it	O O B-EMO O	happiness	151
every one feeling so happy at the prospect of meeting so soon the good king Rumanika	O O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	151
Tripping down the greensward	O O O O	happiness	151
we now worked our way to the Rozoka valley	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	151
and pitched our tents in the village.	O O O O O O O	happiness	151
Now	O	happiness	152
the real facts of the case were these--though I did not find them out at the time:-- Baraka had bought some slaves with my effects	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	152
and he had had a fight with some of my men because they tampered with his temporary wife--a princess he had picked up in Phunze	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	152
To obtain her hand he had given ten necklaces of MY beads to her mother	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	152
and had agreed to the condition that he should keep the girl during the journey	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	152
and after it was over	O O O O O	happiness	152
and he took her home	O O O O O	happiness	152
he would	O O	happiness	152
if his wife pleased him	O O O B-EMO O	happiness	152
give her mother ten necklaces more.	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	152
Ever anxious to push on with the journey	O O O O O O O O	sadness	153
as I felt every day's delay only tended to diminish my means--that is	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	153
my beads and copper wire--I instructed Bombay to take the under-mentioned articles to Rumanika as a small sample of the products of my country	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	153
[FN11] to say I felt quite ashamed of their being so few and so poor	O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	153
but I hoped he would forgive my shortcomings	O O O O O O O O	sadness	153
as he knew I had been so often robbed on the way to him	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	153
and I trusted	O O O	sadness	153
in recollection of Musa	O O O O	sadness	153
he would give me leave to go on to Uganda	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	153
for every day's delay was consuming my supplies.	O O O O O O O O	sadness	153
Next morning	O O	disgust	154
however	O	disgust	154
on seeing me actually preparing to start	O O O O O O O	disgust	154
Lumeresi found he could not let me go until I increased the tax by three more cloths	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	154
as some of his family complained that they had got nothing	O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	154
After some badgering	O O O	disgust	154
I paid what he asked for	O O O O O O	disgust	154
and ordered the men to carry me out of the palace before anything else was done	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	154
for I would not sleep another night where I was.	O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	154
Neither his father nor any of his forefathers had had such a great favour shown them	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	155
He was alarmed	O O O	happiness	155
he confessed	O O	happiness	155
when he heard we were coming to visit him	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	155
thinking we might prove some fearful monsters that were not quite human	O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	155
but now he was delighted beyond all measure with what he saw of us	O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	155
A messenger should be sent at once to the king of Uganda to inform him of our intention to visit him	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	155
with his own favourable report of us.	O O O O O O O	happiness	155
With at last a sufficiency of porters	O O O O O O O	happiness	156
we all set out together	O O O O O	happiness	156
walking over a new style of country	O O O O O O O	happiness	156
Instead of the constantly- recurring outcrops of granite	O O O O O O O O	happiness	156
as in Unyamuezi	O O O	happiness	156
with valleys between	O O O	happiness	156
there were only two lines of little hills visible	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	156
one right and one left of us	O O O O O O O	happiness	156
a good way off	O O O O	happiness	156
whilst the ground over which we were travelling	O O O O O O O O	happiness	156
instead of being confined like a valley	O O O O O O O	happiness	156
rose in long high swells of sandstone formation	O O O O O O O O	happiness	156
covered with small forest-trees	O O O O	happiness	156
among which flowers like primroses	O O O O O	happiness	156
only very much larger	O O O O	happiness	156
and mostly of a pink colour	O O O O O O	happiness	156
were frequently met with	O O O O	happiness	156
Indeed	O	happiness	156
we ought all to have been happy together	O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO	happiness	156
for all my men were paid and rationed trebly--far better than they would have been if they had been travelling with any one else	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	156
but I had not paid all	O O O O O O	happiness	156
as they thought	O O O	happiness	156
proportionably	O	happiness	156
and therefore there were constant heartburnings	O O O O O O	happiness	156
with strikes and rows every day.	O O O O O O	happiness	156
Here some of the porters	O O O O O	disgust	157
attempting to bolt	O O O	disgust	157
were intercepted by my coast-men and had a fight of it	O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	157
for they fired arrows	O O O O	disgust	157
and in return the coast-men cut their bows	O O O O O O O O	disgust	157
The whole camp	O O O	disgust	157
of course	O O	disgust	157
was in a blaze at this	O O O O O O	disgust	157
their tribe was insulted	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	157
and they would not stand it	O O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO	disgust	157
until Bombay put down their pride with a few strings of beads	O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	157
as the best means of restoring peace in the camp.	O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	157
At this place we were visited by the chief of the district	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	158
Pongo (Bush-boc)	O O	fear	158
who had left his palace to see us and invite us his way	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	158
for he feared we might give him the slip by going west into Uyofu	O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	158
He sent us a cow	O O O O O	fear	158
and said he should like some return	O O O O O O O	fear	158
for Masudi	O O	fear	158
who had gone ahead	O O O O	fear	158
only gave him a trifle	O O O O O	fear	158
professing to be our vanguard	O O O O O	fear	158
and telling him that as soon as we came with the large caravan we would satisfy him to his heart's content.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	158
It was given	O O O	anger	159
after many angry words	O O O O	anger	159
but it was the old story over again-- he would have one more wire and a cloth	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	159
or else he would not allow us to proceed on the morrow	O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	159
My men	O O	anger	159
this time really provoked	O O O B-EMO	anger	159
said they would fight it out	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	159
--a king breaking his word in that way	O O O O O O O O	anger	159
But in the end the demand had to be paid	O O O O O O O O O O	anger	159
and at last	O O O	anger	159
at 9 P	O O O	anger	159
the drums beat the satisfaction.	O O O O O	anger	159
Just then Bombay returned flushed with the excitement of a great success	O O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	161
He had been in Masudi's camp	O O O O O O	happiness	161
and had delivered my message to Insangez	O O O O O O O	happiness	161
Asudi	O	happiness	161
he said	O O	happiness	161
had been there a fortnight unable to settle his hongo	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	161
for the great Mkama had not deigned to see him	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	161
though the Arab had been daily to his palace requesting an interview	O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	161
"""Well"	O	happiness	161
""" I said"	O O O	happiness	161
"""that is all very interesting"	O O O O O	happiness	161
but what next	O O O	happiness	161
--will the big king see us	O O O O O O	happiness	161
On leaving this interesting place	O O O O O	surprise	162
with the widespread information of all the surrounding countries I had gained	O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	162
my mind was so impressed with the topographical features of all this part of Africa	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	162
that in my heart I resolved I would make Rumanika as happy as he had made me	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	162
and asked K'yengo his doctor	O O O O O	surprise	162
of all things I possessed what the king would like best	O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	162
To my surprise I then learnt that Rumanika had set his heart on the revolving rifle I had brought for Mtesa--the one	O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O	surprise	162
in fact	O O	surprise	162
which he had prevented my sending on to Uganda in the hands of Kachuchu	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	162
and he would have begged me for it before had his high-minded dignity	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	162
and the principle he had established of never begging for anything	O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	162
not interfered.	O O	surprise	162
The flatterers said	O O O	happiness	163
"""It is as clear as possible"	O O O O O O	happiness	163
God gave the thunderbolt to Dagaro as a sign he was pleased with him and his rule	O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	163
but when he found two brothers contending	O O O O O O O	happiness	163
"he withdrew it to show their conduct was wicked."""	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	163
Before breaking up	O O O	happiness	164
Rumanika wished to give me any number of ivories I might like to mention	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	164
even three or four hundred	O O O O O	happiness	164
as a lasting remembrance that I had done him the honour of visiting Karague in his lifetime	O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	164
for though Dagara had given to coloured merchants	O O O O O O O O	happiness	164
he would be the first who had given to a white man	O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	164
Of course this royal offer was declined with politeness	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	164
he must understand that it was not the custom of big men in my country to accept presents of value when we made visits of pleasure	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	165
I had enjoyed my residence in Karague	O O O O O O O	happiness	165
his intellectual conversations and his kind hospitality	O O O O O O O	happiness	165
all of which I should record in my books to hand down to posterity	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	165
but if he would give me a cow's horn	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	165
I would keep it as a trophy of the happy days I had spent in his country	O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O O O O O O O	happiness	165
He gave me one	O O O O	happiness	165
measuring 3 feet 5 inches in length	O O O O O O O	happiness	165
and 18 3/4 inches in circumference at the base.	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	165
n a minute or two afterwards	O O O O O O	surprise	166
the good young princes	O O O O	surprise	166
attracted by the sound of the gun	O O O O O O O	surprise	166
came to see what was done	O O O O O O	surprise	166
Their surprise knew no bounds	O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	166
they could scarcely believe what they saw	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	166
and then	O O	surprise	166
on recovering	O O	surprise	166
with the spirit of true gentlemen	O O O O O O	surprise	166
they seized both my hands	O O O O O	surprise	166
congratulating me on the magnitude of my success	O O O O O O O O	surprise	166
and pointed out	O O O	surprise	166
as an example of it	O O O O O	surprise	166
a bystander who showed fearful scars	O O O O O O	surprise	166
both on his abdomen and at the blade of his shoulder	O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	166
who they declared had been run through by one of these animals.	O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	166
heir surprise knew no bounds	O O O O O	happiness	167
they could scarcely believe what they saw	O O O O O O O	happiness	167
and then	O O	happiness	167
on recovering	O O	happiness	167
with the spirit of true gentlemen	O O O O O O	happiness	167
they seized both my hands	O O O O O	happiness	167

who they declared had been run through by one of these animals	O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	167
It was	O O	happiness	167
therefore	O	happiness	167
wonderful to them	B-EMO O O	happiness	167
they observed	O O	happiness	167
with what calmness I went up to such formidable beasts.	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	167
In the evening we had another row with my head men--Baraka having accused Bombay of trying to kill him with magic	O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	168
Bombay	O	disgust	168
who was so incessantly bullied by Baraka's officious attempts to form party cliques opposed to the interests of the journey	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	168
and get him turned out of the camp	O O O O O O O O	disgust	168
indiscreetly went to one of K'yengo's men	O O O O O O O	disgust	168
and asked him if he knew of any medicine that would affect the hearts of the Wanguana so as to incline them towards him	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	168
and on the sub-doctor saying Yes	O O O O O O	disgust	168
Bombay gave him some beads	O O O O O	disgust	168
and bought the medicine required	O O O O O	disgust	168
which	O	disgust	168
put into a pot of pombe	O O O O O O	disgust	168
was placed by Baraka's side.	O O O O O	disgust	168
Some other travellers from the north again informed us that they had heard of Wanguana who attempted to trade in Gani and Chopi	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	170
but were killed by the natives	O O O O O O	sadness	170
I now assured Rumanika that in two or three years he would have a greater trade with Egypt than he ever could have with Zanzibar	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	170
for when I opened the road	O O O O O O	sadness	170
all those men he heard of would swarm up here to visit him	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	170
however	O	sadness	170
only laughed at my folly in proposing to go to a place of which all I heard was merely that every stranger who went there was killed	O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	170
He began to show a disinclination to allow my going there	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	171
and though from the most friendly intention	O O O O O O O	fear	171
this view was alarming	O O O O	fear	171
for one word from him could have ruined my projects	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	171
As it was	O O O	fear	171
I feared my followers might take fright and refuse to advance with me	O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	171
I thought it good policy to talk of there being many roads leading through Africa	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	171
so that Rumanika might see he had not got	O O O O O O O O O	fear	171
as he thought	O O O	fear	171
the sole key to the interior.	O O O O O O	fear	171
Although	O	happiness	172
however	O	happiness	172
this very interesting people	O O O O	happiness	172
the Wahuma	O O	happiness	172
delight in supposing themselves to be of European origin	B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	172
they are forced to confess	O O O O O	happiness	172
on closer examination	O O O	happiness	172
that although they came in the first instance from the doubtful north	O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	172
they came latterly from the east	O O O O O O	happiness	172
as part of a powerful Wahuma tribe	O O O O O O O	happiness	172
beyond Kidi	O O	happiness	172
who excel in arms	O O O O	happiness	172
and are so fierce no Kidi people	O O O O O O O	happiness	172
terrible in war as these too are described to be	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	172
can stand against them.	O O O O	happiness	172
after ordering all the seizures to be given up to Maula on behalf of the king	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	173
and threatening to discharge any of my men who dared retain one item of the property	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	173
I shut the door of my hut to do penance for two days	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	173
giving orders that nobody but my cook Ilmas	O O O O O O O O	sadness	173
not even Bombay	O O O	sadness	173
should come near me	O O O O	sadness	173
for the king had caused my men to sin--had disgraced their red cloth--and had inflicted on me a greater insult than I could bear	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	173
I was ashamed to show my face	O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	173
Just as the door was closed	O O O O O O	sadness	173
other pages from the king brought the Whitworth rifle to be cleaned	O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	173
and demanded an admittance	O O O O	sadness	173
On Maula's return	O O O	happiness	174
I was told the king would not believe so generous a man as Bana could have sent him so few beads	O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	174
he believed most of my store must have been stolen on the road	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	174
and would ask me about that to-morrow.	O O O O O O O	happiness	174
He intimated that for the future I must fire a gun at the waiting-hut whenever I entered the palace	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	175
so that he might hear of my arrival	O O O O O O O O	fear	175
for he had been up that morning	O O O O O O O	fear	175
and would have been glad to see me	O O O O O O O O	fear	175
only the boys	O O O	fear	175
from fear of entering his cabinet	O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	175
had forged a lie	O O O O	fear	175
and deprived him of any interview with me	O O O O O O O O	fear	175
which he had long wished to get.	O O O O O O O	fear	175
In a little while I felt tired of the monotony	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	176
and wished to hang up a curtain	O O O O O O O	sadness	176
that I might lie down in privacy and sleep till the king was ready	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	176
but the officers in waiting forbade this	O O O O O O O	sadness	176
as contrary to law	O O O O	sadness	176
and left me the only alternative of walking up and down the court to kill time	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	176
spreading my umbrella against the powerful rays of the sun	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	176
A very little of that made me fidgety and impetuous	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	176
which the Waganda noticed	O O O O	sadness	176
and	O	sadness	176
from fear of the consequences	O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU	sadness	176
they began to close the gate to prevent my walking away.	O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	176
Until now I did not feel sure where the various rush-drains I had been crossing since leaving the Katonga valley all went to	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	177
but here my mind was made up	O O O O O O O	happiness	177
for I found a large volume of water going to the northwards	O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	177
I took off my clothes at the end of the bridge and jumped into the stream	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	177
which I found was twelve yards or so broad	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	177
and deeper than my height	O O O O O	happiness	177
I was delighted beyond measure at this very surprising fact	O O B-EMO O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	177
that I was indeed on the northern slopes of the continent	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	177
and had	O O	happiness	177
to all appearance	O O O	happiness	177
found one of the branches of the Nile's exit from the N'yanza.	O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	177
The first court passed	O O O O	surprise	179
I was even more surprised to find the unusual ceremonies that awaited me	O O O O B-EMO O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O	surprise	179
There courtiers of high dignity stepped forward to greet me	O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	179
dressed in the most scrupulously neat fashions	O O O O O O O	surprise	179
Men	O	surprise	179
women	O	surprise	179
bulls	O	surprise	179
dogs	O	surprise	179
and goats	O O	surprise	179
were led about by strings	O O O O O	surprise	179
cocks and hens were carried in men's arms	O O O O O O O O	surprise	179
and little pages	O O O	surprise	179
with rope-turbans	O O	surprise	179
rushed about	O O	surprise	179
conveying messages	O O	surprise	179
as if their lives depended on their swiftness	O O O O O O O O	surprise	179
every one holding his skin-cloak tightly round him lest his naked legs might by accident be shown.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	179
but Ntalo won't be done	O O O O O	disgust	180
so retorts by saying	O O O O	disgust	180
"""Sangizo"	O	disgust	180

you are a savage--a Mshezi	O O O O O	disgust	180

"so hold your impudent tongue"""	O O O O O	disgust	180
--and the camp pealed with merry boisterous laughter again.	O O O O O O O O O	disgust	180
And all the men of the camp laugh together at the wretched Ntalo's defeat	O O O O O O O B-EMO O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	181

The king acknowledged the truthfulness of their story	O O O O O O O O	happiness	182
saying he had heard the same himself	O O O O O O O	happiness	182
and both Wakungu	O O O	happiness	182
as is the custom in Uganda	O O O O O O	happiness	182
thanked their lord in a very enthusiastic manner	O O O O O O B-EMO O	happiness	182
kneeling on the ground- -for no one can stand in the presence of his majesty--in an attitude of prayer	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	182
and throwing out their hands as they repeated the words N'yanzig	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	182

ai N'yanzig Mkahma wangi	O O O O	happiness	182

etc	O	happiness	182
for a considerable time	O O O O	happiness	182
when	O	happiness	182
thinking they had done enough of this	O O O O O O O	happiness	182
and heated with the exertion	O O O O O	happiness	182
they threw themselves flat upon their stomachs	O O O O O O O	happiness	182
and	O	happiness	182
floundering about like fish on land	O O O O O O	happiness	182
repeated the same words over again and again	O O O O O O O O	happiness	182
and rose doing the same	O O O O O	happiness	182
with their faces covered with earth	O O O O O O	happiness	182
for majesty in Uganda is never satisfied till subjects have grovelled before it like the most abject worms.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	182
She admitted me at once	O O O O O	anger	183
when I gave her quinine	O O O O O	anger	183
on the proviso that I should stop there all day and night to repeat the dose	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	183
and tell her the reason why I did not come before	O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	183
She affected great anger at Mtesa having interfered with my servants when coming to see her--sympathised with me on the distance I had to travel--ordered a hut to be cleared for me ere night--told me to eat my breakfast in the next court--and	O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	183
rising abruptly	O O	anger	183
walked away	O O	anger	183
At noon we heard the king approaching with his drums and rattle-traps	O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	183
but I still waited on till 5 p	O O O O O O O O	anger	183
when	O	anger	183
on summons	O O	anger	183
I repaired to the throne-hut.	O O O O O	anger	183

To-day the king went the round of his relations	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	184
"showing the beautiful things given him by the white man--a clear proof that he was much favoured by the ""spirits"	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	184
""" for neither his father nor any of his forefathers had been so recognised and distinguished by any ""sign"" as a rightful inheritor to the Uganda throne: an anti-Christian interpretation of omens"	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	184
as rife in these dark regions now as it was in the time of King Nebuchadnezzar	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	184
At midnight the three muskets were returned	O O O O O O O	happiness	184
and I was so pleased with the young king's promptitude and honesty	O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	184
I begged he would accept them.	O O O O O O	happiness	184
Here I heard	O O O	happiness	185
in an adjoining court	O O O O	happiness	185
the boisterous	O O	happiness	185
explosive laughs of both mother and son--royal shouts loud enough to be heard a mile off	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	185
and inform the community that their sovereigns were pleased to indulge in hilarity	O O O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	185
Immediately afterwards	O O	happiness	185
the gate between us being thrown open	O O O O O O O	happiness	185
the king	O O	happiness	185
like a very child	O O O O	happiness	185
stood before us	O O O	happiness	185
dressed for the first time	O O O O O	happiness	185
in public	O O	happiness	185
in what Europeans would call clothes.	O O O O O O	happiness	185
And when the whole story was fully narrated	O O O O O O O O	sadness	186
the matter was thought a good joke	O O O O O O O	sadness	186
After pausing a little	O O O O	sadness	186
I asked the king what ailed him	O O O O O O O	sadness	186
for I was sorry to hear he had been sick	O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	186
but instead of replying	O O O O	sadness	186
he shook his head	O O O O	sadness	186
as much as to say	O O O O O	sadness	186
I had put a very uncouth question to his majesty--and ordered some men to shoot cows.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	186
Early in the morning	O O O O	surprise	187
as I expected	O O O	surprise	187
she demanded my immediate attendance	O O O O O	surprise	187
and so the little diplomatic affair I had anticipated came on	O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	187
I began the affair by intimating that I am in bed	O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	187
and have not breakfasted	O O O O	surprise	187
So at 10 a	O O O O	surprise	187
another messenger arrives	O O O	surprise	187
to say her majesty is much surprised at my not coming	O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	187
What can such conduct mean	O O O O O	surprise	187
when she arranged everything so nicely for me after my own desire	O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	187
that she might drink her medicine properly	O O O O O O O	surprise	187
Instead of admiring this childish pastime	O O O O O O	sadness	188
which in Uganda is considered royal sport	O O O O O O O	sadness	188
I rather looked disdainful	O O O O	sadness	188
until	O	sadness	188
apparently disappointed at my indifference	O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	188
he asked what the box I had brought contained	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	188
On being told it was the medicine he desired	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	188
he asked me to draw near	O O O O O O	sadness	188
and sent his courtiers away	O O O O O	sadness	188
When only the interpreters and one confidential officer were left	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	188
besides myself	O O	sadness	188
he wished to know if I could apply the medicine without its touching the afflicted part.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	188
What can such conduct mean	O O O O O	fear	189
when she arranged everything so nicely for me after my own desire	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	189
that she might drink her medicine properly	O O O O O O O	fear	189
Still I am not up	O O O O O	fear	189
but nobody will let me rest for fear of the queen	O O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU	fear	189
so	O	fear	189
to while away the time	O O O O O	fear	189
I order Bombay to call upon her	O O O O O O O	fear	189
give the quinine	O O O	fear	189
and tell her all that has happened	O O O O O O O	fear	189
We reached the Cowes by torchlight at 9 p	O O O O O O O O O	surprise	190
when the king had a picnic dinner with me	O O O O O O O O O	surprise	190
turned in with his women in great comfort	O O O O O O O O	surprise	190
and sent me off to a dreary hut	O O O O O O O O	surprise	190
where I had to sleep upon a grass-strew floor	O O O O O O O O O	surprise	190
I was surprised we had to walk so far	O O B-EMO O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	190
when	O	surprise	190
by appearance	O O	surprise	190
we might have boated it from the head of the creek all the way down	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	190
but	O	surprise	190
on inquiry	O O	surprise	190
was informed of the swampy nature of the ground at the head of the creek precluded any approach to the clear water there	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	190
and hence the long overland journey	O O O O O O	surprise	190
which	O	surprise	190
though fatiguing to the unfortunate women	O O O O O O	surprise	190
who had to trot the whole way behind Mtesa's four-mile-an-hour strides	O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	190
was very amusing.	O O B-EMO	surprise	190
He stared	O O	happiness	191
and everybody stared	O O O	happiness	191
believing me to be a magician	O O O O O O	happiness	191
when the king said he would like to have pictures of the birds drawn and hung up in the palace	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	191
"""but let us go and shoot some more"	O O O O O O O O	happiness	191
for it is truly wonderful	O O O O B-EMO	happiness	191

swing Suzanne at arm's length	O O O O O	fear	209

very slowly	O O	surprise	211
she looked around	O O O	surprise	211

``She is my mother	O O O O	anger	212

And when from the fort they saw us coming across the fields they opened the gates in astonishment	O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O B-EMO I-EMO	surprise	215
and on hearing the news gave themselves over to the wildest rejoicing	O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	215
For the backwoodsmen were children of nature	O O O O O O O	surprise	215
Bill Cowan ran for the fiddle which he had carried so carefully over the mountain	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	215
and that night we had jigs and reels on the common while the big fellow played ``Billy of the Wild Woods'' and ``Jump Juba	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	215
'' with all his might	O O O O O	surprise	215
and the pine knots threw their fitful	O O O O O O O	surprise	215
red light on the wild scenes of merriment	O O O O O O O O	surprise	215
I must have cut a queer little figure as I sat between Cowan and Tom watching the dance	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	215
for presently Colonel Clark came up to us	O O O O O O O O	surprise	215
laughing in his quiet way.	O O O O O	surprise	215
Then came the sugaring	O O O O	happiness	217
the warm days and the freezing nights when the earth stirs in her sleep and the taps drip from red sunrise to red sunset	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	217
Old and young went to the camps	O O O O O O O	happiness	217
the women and children boiling and graining	O O O O O O O	happiness	217
the squads of men posted in guards round about	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	217
And after that the days flew so quickly that it seemed as if the woods had burst suddenly into white flower	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	217
and it was spring again	O O O O O	happiness	217
And then--a joy to be long remembered --I went on a hunting trip with Tom and Cowan and three others where the Kentucky tumbles between its darkly wooded cliffs	O O B-EMO O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	217
And other wonders of that strange land I saw then for the first time: great licks	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	217
trampled down for acres by the wild herds	O O O O O O O O	happiness	217
where the salt water oozes out of the hoofprints	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	217
On the edge of one of these licks we paused and stared breathless at giant bones sticking here and there in the black mud	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	217
and great skulls of fearful beasts half-embedded	O O O O O O O	happiness	217
This was called the Big Bone Lick	O O O O O O O	happiness	217
and some travellers that went before us had made their tents with the thighs of these monsters of a past age.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	217
Then I heard a voice calling me	O O O O O O O	surprise	218
and pushing past Mrs	O O O O	surprise	218

I ran into the cabin	O O O O O	surprise	218

The Indians had shot at a party shelling corn at Captain Bowman's plantation	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	219

James Ray had ridden to Harrodstown for succor	O O O O O O O O	anger	219

the prospect of banishment from the homes we could almost see	O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	219
staring us in the face	O O O O O	anger	219
and the labors of the spring lost again	O O O O O O O O	anger	219
There was bitter talk within the gates that night	O O O O O O O O O	anger	219
and many declared angrily that Colonel Clark had abandoned us	O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	219
But I remembered what he had said	O O O O O O O	anger	219

They turned	O O	happiness	220

But scarce could they have reached the street and we have broken ranks	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	220
when we saw them coming back again	O O O O O O O	happiness	220
the priest leading them as before	O O O O O O	happiness	220
They drew near to the spot where Clark stood	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	220
talking to the captains	O O O O	happiness	220
and halted expectantly.	O O O	happiness	220
The group stood wistful	O O O O	fear	221
fearful that their boldness had displeased	B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	221
expectant of reprimand.	O O O	fear	221
At length the cocks crowing for day proclaimed the morning	O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	222
and while yet the blue shadow of the bluff was on the town	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	222
Colonel Clark sallied out of the gate and walked abroad	O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	222
Strange it seemed that war had come to this village	B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	222
so peaceful and remote	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	222
And even stranger it seemed to me to see these Arcadian homes in the midst of the fierce wilderness.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	222
Excitement keyed us high	O O O O	surprise	223
we reached the shade	O O O O	surprise	223
plunged into it	O O O	surprise	223
and presently came out staring at the bastioned corners of a fort which rose from the centre of a clearing	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	223
It had once defended the place	O O O O O O	surprise	223
but now stood abandoned and dismantled	O O O O O O	surprise	223
Beyond it	O O	surprise	223
at the edge of the bluff	O O O O O O	surprise	223
we halted	O O	surprise	223
astonished	B-EMO	surprise	223
The sun was falling in the west	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	223

At our feet	O O O	surprise	223
across the wooded bottom	O O O O	surprise	223
was the Kaskaskia River	O O O O	surprise	223
and beyond	O O	surprise	223
the peaceful little French village with its low houses and orchards and gardens colored by the touch of the evening light.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	223

rubbing the hard dirt on the floor with the toe of my moccasin.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	224
Suddenly	O	fear	225
with the deftness of a panther	O O O O O O	fear	225
an Indian shot forward and lifted me high in his arms	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	225
To this day I recall my terror as I dangled in mid-air	O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	225
staring into a hideous face	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	225
By intuition I kicked him in the stomach with all my might	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	225
and with a howl of surprise and rage his fingers gripped into my flesh.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	225
On such occasions the current of time runs sluggish	O O O O O O O O O	fear	226
Thrice our muscles were startled into tenseness by the baying of a hound	O O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	226
and once a cock crew out of all season	O O O O O O O O O	fear	226
For the night was cloudy and pitchy black	O O O O O O O O	fear	226
and the dawn as far away as eternity.	O O O O O O O O	fear	226
He turned from them once more	O O O O O O	sadness	227
they went away in a dejection to wring our compassion	O O O O O B-EMO O O O O	sadness	227
and we thought the matter ended at last	O O O O O O O O	sadness	227
The sun was falling low	O O O O O	sadness	227
the people beginning to move away	O O O O O O	sadness	227
when	O	sadness	227
to the astonishment of all	B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO	sadness	227
the culprits were seen coming back again	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	227
With them were two young men of their own nation	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	227

Just then I heard her calling out to me.	O O O O O O O O O	fear	232
I flushed again	O O O	fear	233

Presently my father looked up from his book	O O O O O O O O	surprise	234
but did not rise	O O O O	surprise	234
As for me	O O O	surprise	234
I had been staring for some time in astonishment	O O O O O O O O B-EMO	surprise	234
for he was a better-looking man than I had ever seen	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	234
He wore a deerskin hunting shirt dyed black	O O O O O O O O	surprise	234

in place of a coonskin cap with the tail hanging down	O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	234

I recall a fear that my father would not fancy him	O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	235
In such cases he would give a stranger food	O O O O O O O O O	fear	235

And a violent scene followed.	O O O O O	fear	236
Then the moment of departure came	O O O O O O	happiness	237
Mademoiselle Marguerite acknowledged the parting remarks of the servants	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	237
who were secretly delighted to be freed from her presence	O O B-EMO I-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	237
and then	O O	happiness	237
before entering the carriage	O O O O	happiness	237
she cast a long	O O O O	happiness	237
sad look upon this princely mansion which she had once had the right to believe her own	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	237
but which she was	O O O O	happiness	237
alas	O	happiness	237
now leaving	O O	happiness	237
in all probability	O O O	happiness	237
for ever.	O O	happiness	237
The worthy housekeeper was present at this conference	O O O O O O O O	fear	238
For an instant she had feared that Mademoiselle Marguerite suspected her manoeuvres but her fears were now dispelled	O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O	fear	238
and she even congratulated herself on her skilfulness.	O O O O O O O O	fear	238
This furnished Madame de Fondege with another excuse for proffering her advice	O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	239
But Mademoiselle Marguerite would not allow herself to be convinced at once	O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	239
She raised a great many objections	O O O O O O	happiness	239
and parleyed for a long time before telling Madame de Fondege that she would be happy to accept the hospitality which had been offered her	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	239
And her consent was by no means unconditional.	O O O O O O O O	happiness	239
Fortunat's address must be there	O O O O O	happiness	240
so she asked and obtained permission to examine this note- book	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	240
and to her great joy	O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO	happiness	240
"under the letter ""F"	O O O O	happiness	240

she was extremely surprised that he had not yet put in an appearance.	O O B-EMO I-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	241
It was easy to see by Madame de Fondege's earnestness that she feared Mademoiselle Marguerite would avail herself of this opportunity of recovering her liberty	O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	242

Marguerite's only reply was a despairing gesture	O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO	sadness	243
It would have been impossible for her to articulate a syllable--her tears were choking her.	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O	sadness	243
Arrayed in his best uniform	O O O O O	fear	244
his thin legs encased in black silk stockings	O O O O O O O O	fear	244
his mantle thrown gracefully over his shoulders	O O O O O O O	fear	244
and his cocked hat under his arm	O O O O O O O	fear	244
he was looking anxiously about for some one in the assembled crowd to whom he could give the signal for departure	O O O B-EMO O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	244
He was already talking of starting off when M	O O O O O O O O O	fear	244

I must fulfil a sacred duty	O O O O O O	disgust	245

"It is the first time in my life that I was ever behind time."""	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	245
But how she revenged herself	O O O O O	sadness	246
"She was ""virtuous"	O O O	sadness	246
""" but so dangerously virtuous that one might have supposed she was so against her will"	O O O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	246

She ruled her husband with a rod of iron.	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	246
I searched under all the trees	O O O O O O	fear	247
and yet I could not find her	O O O O O O O	fear	247
It was as dark as pitch	O O O O O O	fear	247
and suddenly a terrible fear seized hold of me--such a terrible fright that I really believe I called for help	O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	247
"and I ran back to the house half crazed."""	O O O O O O O O O	fear	247
But the worthy woman had already recovered her self-possession and her accustomed loquacity at the same time	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	248
"""Ah"	O	sadness	248

it was only from the kindest of motives that I ventured into the garden	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	248

He was in all the greater haste as it was Sunday	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	249
Fortunat was in the habit of passing these days in the country	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	249

And while running to the Place de la Bourse	O O O O O O O O O	fear	249
he carefully prepared the story he meant to relate	O O O O O O O O O	fear	249
"deeply impressed by the wisdom of the popular maxim which says: ""It is not always well to tell the whole truth."""	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	249
Still it did not prevent him from trying to justify himself	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	250
although he was careful not to confess the truth	O O O O O O O O O	fear	250
for he dreaded his mother's censure	O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	250
knowing well enough that she would be less indulgent than his own conscience.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	250
However	O	anger	251
the effect of this discovery was to dispel his anger	O O O O O O O O O O	anger	251

in trying to set a name on this face	O O O O O O O O O	anger	254

She raised one objection after another	O O O O O O	disgust	281

made this organization doubly terrible	O O O B-EMO I-EMO	fear	382

Still more surprised was he on the entering to find two young men in possession of his sitting-room	O B-EMO I-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	386
One	O	surprise	386
with a longpale face	O O O O	surprise	386
was leaning back in the rocking-chair	O O O O O O	surprise	386
with his feet cocked upupon the stove	O O O O O O O	surprise	386
The other	O O	surprise	386
a bull-necked youth with coarse	O O O O O	surprise	386
bloatedfeatures	O	surprise	386
was standing in front of the window with his hands in hispockets whistling a popular hymn	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	386
Both of them nodded to Ferrier as heentered	O O O O O O O O	surprise	386
and the one in the rocking-chair commenced the conversation.	O O O O O O O O O	surprise	386
How this warning came into his room puzzled John Ferrier sorely	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU B-EMO O O O	disgust	387
for hisservants slept in an outhouse	O O O O O O	disgust	387
and the doors and windows had all been secured	O O O O O O O O O	disgust	387
He crumpled the paper up and said nothing to his daughter	O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	387
butthe incident struck a chill into his heart	O O O O O O O O	disgust	387
The twenty-nine days wereevidently the balance of the month which Young had promised.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	387
Still more shaken was he next morning	O O O O O O O	surprise	388
They had sat down to their breakfast	O O O O O O O	surprise	388
when Lucy with a cry of surprise pointed upwards	O O O O O O B-EMO O O	surprise	388
In the centre of the ceiling was scrawled	O O O O O O O O	surprise	388
with a burned stick apparently	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	388
the number 28	O O O	surprise	388
To his daughter it was unintelligible	O O O O O O	surprise	388
and he did not enlightenher	O O O O O	surprise	388
That night he sat up with his gun and kept watch and ward.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	388
He walked for a couple of miles through one ravine after anotherwithout [72] success	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	389
though	O	sadness	389
from the marks upon the bark of the trees	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	389
and other indications	O O O	sadness	389
he judged that there were numerous bears in thevicinity	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	389
At last	O O	sadness	389
after two or three hours   fruitless search	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O	sadness	389
he was thinking of turning back in despair	O O O O O O O B-EMO	sadness	389
when casting his eyes upwards he saw a sightwhich sent a thrill of pleasure through his heart	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	389
On the edge of a juttingpinnacle	O O O O O O	sadness	389
three or four hundred feet above him	O O O O O O O	sadness	389
there stood a creature somewhat resembling a sheep in appearance	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	389
but armed with a pair ofgigantic horns.	O O O O O O O	sadness	389
He had now come to the mouth of the very defile in which he had left  them	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	390
Even in the darkness he could recognize the outline of the cliffs which bounded it	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	390
They must	O O	fear	390
he reflected	O O	fear	390
be awaiting him anxiously	O O O B-EMO	fear	390
for he had been absent nearly five hours	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	390
In the gladness of his heart he puthis hands to his mouth and made the glen reecho to a loud halloo as asignal that he was coming	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	390
He paused and listened for an answer.	O O O O O O O	fear	390
Their faces were pale and sad	O O O O O O	fear	391
and there were tears in the eyes of some of them	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	391
What was passing in their minds	O O O O O O	fear	391
Perhaps they were overcome by that unconquerable fear which sudden and unexpected death always provokes	O O O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	391
Perhaps they unconsciously loved this master	O O O O O O	fear	391
whose bread they ate	O O O O	fear	391
Perhaps their grief was only selfishness	O O O O O O	fear	391
and they were merely wondering what would become of them	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	391
where they should find another situation	O O O O O O	fear	391
and if it would prove a good one.	O O O O O O O O	fear	391
Deeply moved by the sight of this despair	O O O O O O O B-EMO	fear	393
the servants held their breath	O O O O O	fear	393
wondering how it would all end	O O O O O O	fear	393
It ended suddenly	O O O	fear	393
The girl sprang from her knees	O O O O O O	fear	393

Feeling that he had just committed a terrible blunder	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	414
he racked his brain to find some way of repairing it	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	414
and finding none	O B-CAU I-CAU	sadness	414

He took them	O O O	fear	415
without even asking the mother if she had enough left to purchase her dinner that evening	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	415
and the fine gentleman	O O O O	fear	415
who had won and pocketed Jules Chazel's stolen gold	O O O O O O O O O	fear	415
thought the banker's conduct perfectly natural and just	O O O O O O O O	fear	415
It is true that Madame d'Argeles was in despair during forty-eight hours or so	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	415
for the police had begun a sort of investigation	O O O O O O O O O	fear	415
and she feared this might frighten her visitors and empty her drawing- rooms	O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	415
Not at all	O O O	fear	415
however	O	fear	415
on the contrary	O O O	fear	415
she had good cause to congratulate herself upon the notoriety she gained through this suicide	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	415
For five days she was the talk of Paris	O O O O O O O O O	fear	415
and Alfred d'Aunay even published her portrait in the Illustrated Chronicle.	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	415
The poor woman--she was a widow--sold all she possessed	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	416
even the bed on which she slept	O O O O O O O	sadness	416
and when she had succeeded in gathering together twenty thousand francs--the ransom of her son's honor--she carried them to the banker by whom her boy had been employed	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	416

however	O	sadness	416
The table itself was adorned with a rich tapestry cover	O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	417
but this was visible only at the corners	O O O O O O O O	surprise	417
for it was covered	O O O O	surprise	417
in turn	O O	surprise	417
with a green baize cloth considerably the worse for wear	O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	417
Madame d'Argeles's guests were probably not over fifty in number	O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	417
but they all seemed to belong to the very best society	O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	417
The majority of them were men of forty or thereabouts	O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	417
several wore decorations	O O O	surprise	417
and two or three of the eldest were treated with marked deference	O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	417
Certain well-known names which Pascal overheard surprised him greatly	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU B-EMO O O	surprise	417
"""What"	O	surprise	417
these men here	O O O	surprise	417
""" he said to himself"	O O O O O	surprise	417
"""and I--I regarded my visit as a sort of clandestine frolic."""	O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	417
A score of persons were seated at the card-table	O O O O O O O O O	surprise	418
and the guests who had retired into the adjoining salon were silently watching the progress of the game	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	418
or quietly chatting in the corners of the room	O O O O O O O O O	surprise	418
It surprised him to note that every one spoke in very low tones	O B-EMO O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	418
there was something very like respect	O O O O O O	surprise	418
even awe	O O	surprise	418
in this subdued murmur	O O O O	surprise	418
One might have supposed that those present were celebrating the rites of some mysterious worship.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	418
The wisest counsels	O O O	anger	419
given in a certain fashion	O O O O O	anger	419
never fail to produce an effect diametrically opposed to that which they seemingly aim at	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	419
de Coralth's persistence	O O O	anger	419
and the importance he attached to a mere trifle	O O O O O O O O O	anger	419
could not fail to annoy the most patient man in the world	O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	419
and in fact his patronizing tone really irritated Pascal	O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O B-EMO O	anger	419
"""You are free"	O O O	anger	419
my friend	O O	anger	419
to do as you please	O O O O O	anger	419
""" said he"	O O O	anger	419
"""but I----"""	O O	anger	419
However the game proceeded	O O O O	sadness	420
but no one paid any attention to it	O O O O O O O O	sadness	420
The stakes were insignificant	O O O O	sadness	420
and loss or gain drew no exclamation from any one	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	420
The attention of the entire party was concentrated on Pascal	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	420
and he	O O	sadness	420
with despair in his heart	B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO	sadness	420
followed the movements of the cards	O O O O O O	sadness	420
which were passing from hand to hand	O O O O O O O	sadness	420
and fast approaching him again	O O O O O	sadness	420
When they reached him the silence became breathless	O O O O O O O O	sadness	420
menacing	O	sadness	420
even sinister.	O O	sadness	420
He did not deign to turn his head	O O O O O O O O	sadness	421
What did the insult matter to him	O O O O O O O	sadness	421
He knew himself to be innocent	O O O O O O	sadness	421
and yet he felt that he was sinking to the lowest depths of infamy--he beheld himself disgraced	O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O B-EMO	sadness	421
branded	O	sadness	421
ruined	O	sadness	421
And realizing that he must meet facts with facts	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	421
he besought God to grant him an idea	O O O O O O O O	sadness	421
an inspiration	O O	sadness	421
that would unmask the real culprit.	O O O O O O	sadness	421
Such was not at all the opinion of the majority of the guests	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	422
Four or five of the ladies took flight at the bare suggestion and several men--the most aristocratic of the company--became angry at once	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O O	anger	422
"""Are you mad"	O O O	anger	422
""" said one of them"	O O O O O	anger	422
"""Do you want to see us all summoned as witnesses"	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	422
You have probably forgotten that Garcia affair	O O O O O O O	anger	422
and that rumpus at Jenny Fancy's house	O O O O O O O	anger	422
A fine thing it would be to see	O O O O O O O O	anger	422
no one knows how many great names mixed up with those of sharpers and notorious women	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	422
Naturally of a florid complexion	O O O O O	fear	423
the baron's face now became scarlet	O O O O O O	fear	423
"""So it's fear of scandal that deters you"	O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	423

sir	O	fear	423
a man's courage should equal his vices	O O O O O O O	fear	423
"Look at me."""	O O O	fear	423
This superb outburst of outraged honor	O O O O O O	fear	424
this marvellous energy-- succeeding	O O O O	fear	424
as it did	O O O	fear	424
the most complete mental prostration--and these terrible threats	O O O O O O O O	fear	424
had proved so prompt and awe-inspiring that no one had thought of cutting off Pascal's retreat	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	424
The guests had not recovered from their stupor	O O O O O O O O	fear	424
but were still standing silent and intimidated when they heard the outer door close after him.	O O O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	424
It shuts its eyes and refuses to look or listen	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	425
But this is all the more reason why it should be pitiless when a person's guilt is positively established	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	425
Thus	O	fear	425
although he assumed an air of insolent security	O O O O O O O O	fear	425
"the ""viscount"" anxiously watched the effect of his words upon Madame d'Argeles"	O O B-EMO I-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	425
Fortunately for himself	O O O	fear	425
he saw that she was abashed by his cynicism	O O O O O O O O O	fear	425
"and so he resumed: ""Besides"	O O O O O	fear	425

You remember	O O	happiness	429
perhaps	O	happiness	429
a little incident that occurred after your return.	O O O O O O O O	happiness	429
She went to sleep one night possessing an income of fifteen thousand francs	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	430
but she awoke to find herself ruined--so completely ruined that she did not know where to obtain her dinner for that same evening	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	430
Had she been alone in the world	O O O O O O O	sadness	430

this disaster would condemn him to enter life through the cramped and gloomy portals of poverty.	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	430

She could scarcely believe it	O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO	surprise	431

and then big tears	O O O O	surprise	431
tears of joy this time	O O O O O	surprise	431
gushed from her eyes.	O O O O	surprise	431
Clients became so numerous that Pascal found it necessary to draw nearer the business centre	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	433
and his rent was consequently doubled	O O O O O O	happiness	433
but the income he derived from his profession increased so rapidly that he soon had twelve thousand francs safely invested as a resource against any emergency	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	433
Madame Ferailleur now laid aside the mourning she had worn since her husband's death	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	433
She felt that she owed it to Pascal	O O O O O O O O	happiness	433

besides	O	happiness	433
after believing there was no more happiness left for her on earth	O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	433

Madame Ferailleur retired at the usual hour	O O O O O O O	fear	434
but she could not sleep	O O O O O	fear	434
She certainly had no cause for anxiety	O O O O O O B-EMO	fear	434
and yet the thought that her son was not at home filled her heart with vague misgivings such as she had never previously felt under similar circumstances.	O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	434

for fear he might return in her absence	O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	435
Thus	O	fear	435
in an agony of suspense	O O O O O	fear	435
she waited--counting the seconds by the quick throbbings of her temples	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	435

Extremely annoyed by this contretemps	O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	440
he took umbrage at an offensive remark made by M	O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	440
de R----	O O	disgust	440
and it was rumored that these gentlemen would cross swords at daybreak this morning.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	440
He little fancied at that supreme moment that each of his gestures	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	441
each contraction of his features	O O O O O	fear	441
were viewed by the mother whose name he faltered	O O O O O O O O O	fear	441
Since her son had left her to go to the Palais de Justice	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	441
the poor woman had remained almost crazy with anxiety	O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO	fear	441
and when she heard him return and lock himself in his office--a thing he had never done before--a fearful presentiment was aroused in her mind	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	441
Gliding into her son's bedroom	O O O O O	fear	441
she at once approached the door communicating with his office.	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	441
The upper part of this portal was of glass	O O O O O O O O O	fear	442
it was possible to see what was occurring in the adjoining room	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	442
When Madame Ferailleur perceived Pascal seat himself at his desk and begin to write	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	442
she felt a trifle reassured	O O O O O	fear	442
and almost thought of going away	O O O O O O	fear	442
But a vague dread	O O O O	fear	442
stronger than reason or will	O O O O O	fear	442
riveted her to the spot	O O O O O	fear	442
A few moments later	O O O O	fear	442
when she saw the revolver in her son's hand	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	442
she understood everything	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	442
Her blood froze in her veins	O O O O O O	fear	442
and yet she had sufficient self-control to repress the cry of terror which sprang to her lips	O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O O O O O	fear	442
She realized that the danger was terrible	O O O O O O O	fear	442
imminent	O	fear	442
extreme	O	fear	442
Her heart	O O	fear	442
rather than her bewildered reason	O O O O O	fear	442
told her that her son's life hung on a single thread	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	442
The slightest sound	O O O	fear	442
a word	O O	fear	442
a rap on the door might hasten the unfortunate man's deed.	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	442
He lowered his head despondently	O O O O B-EMO	sadness	443
and in a tone of profound discouragement	O O O O O O O	sadness	443
"he replied: ""But what can I do"	O O O O O O O	sadness	443

How can I unmask the traitor	O O O O O O	sadness	443

after a thirty hours' journey by rail	O O O O O O O	fear	465
we again entered the count's berline	O O O O O O	fear	465
drawn by post-horses	O O O	fear	465
and eventually M	O O O	fear	465
de Chalusse said to me: 'Here is Cannes--we are at our journey's end.'	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	465
He told me that he proposed spending a few months here in seclusion	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	466
so as to give me time to accustom myself to my new position and the luxury that surrounded me	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	466
I was	O O	sadness	466
indeed	O	sadness	466
extremely awkward	O O	sadness	466
and my excessive timidity was increased by my pride	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	466
I did not know what to say	O O O O O O O	sadness	466
or what to do	O O O O	sadness	466
I did not know how to use my hands	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	466

Everything embarrassed and frightened me	O B-EMO O O O	sadness	466

without being able to remedy it	O O O O O O	sadness	466
I saw my blunders	O O O O	sadness	466
and knew that I spoke a different language to that which was spoken around me	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	466
And yet the memory of Cannes will ever be dear to me	O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	466
For there I first met the only friend I have now left in this world	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	466
I did not exchange a word with him	O O O O O O O O	sadness	466
but by the quickened throbbings of my heart	O O O O O O O O	sadness	466
when our eyes met	O O O O	sadness	466
I felt that he would exert a powerful influence over my life	O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	466
and events have since proved that I was not deceived	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	466
At that time	O O O	sadness	466
however	O	sadness	466
he was a stranger to me	O O O O O O	sadness	466
and nothing on earth would have induced me to make inquiries concerning him.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	466
"""By a single word the count could have insured the happiness of my life and his own"	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	467

when one evening the count returned home more agitated and excited	O O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO	disgust	467
if possible	O O	disgust	467
than on the day of my departure from the asylum	O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	467
He summoned his valet	O O O O	disgust	467
and	O	disgust	467
in a tone that admitted no reply	O O O O O O O	disgust	467
he exclaimed	O O	disgust	467
'I wish to leave Cannes at once-- I must start in less than an hour--so procure some post-horses instantly	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	467
And in answer to my inquiring glance	O O O O O O O	disgust	467
he said: 'It must be	O O O O O	disgust	467

too	O	anger	493
"if he hadn't taken her part because she's pretty--for she is devilishly pretty."""	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	493
"Once more the valet paused in his perusal of the letter to remark: ""There it is again sufficient to live upon"	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	494

by calling to-morrow	O O O	sadness	494
October 15th	O O	sadness	494
at the Hotel de Homburg	O O O O O	sadness	494
in the Rue du Helder	O O O O O	sadness	494
You will ask for Madame Lucy Huntley	O O O O O O O	sadness	494
and they will conduct you to me	O O O O O O O	sadness	494
I shall expect you from three o'clock to six	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	494
Come	O	sadness	494
I implore you	O O O	sadness	494
come	O	sadness	494
It is painful to me to add that if I do not hear from you	O O B-EMO O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	494

so far	O O	sadness	494
asked of you on my bended knees and with clasped hands	O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	494
Having finished the letter	O O O O	fear	495
Casimir laid it on the table	O O O O O O	fear	495
and poured out a glassful of brandy	O O O O O O O	fear	495
which he drained at a single draught	O O O O O O O	fear	495
"""And that's all"	O O O	fear	495
""" he remarked"	O O O	fear	495
"""No signature--not even an initial"	O O O O O	fear	495
It was a so-called respectable woman who wrote that	O O O O O O O O O	fear	495

for fear of compromising themselves	O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU	fear	495
as I've reason to know	O O O O O	fear	495
And so saying	O O O	fear	495
he laughed the idiotic laugh of a man who has been drinking immoderately	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	495
"""If I had time"	O O O O	fear	495
""" he resumed"	O O O	fear	495
"""I should make some inquiries about this Madame Lucy Huntley--a feigned name"	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	495

Monsieur Fortunat	O O	fear	495
You are as pale as death	O O O O O O	fear	495
Are you ill	O O O	fear	495
Fortunat sprang nimbly on to the pavement	O O O O O O O	disgust	496
and handed five francs to the coachman	O O O O O O O	disgust	496
who went off growling and swearing for he thought the reward a contemptibly small one	O O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	496

according to his own confession	O O O O O	disgust	496
However	O	disgust	496
the person the Jehu anathematized certainly did not hear him	O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	496
Standing motionless where he had alighted	O O O O O O	disgust	496
Fortunat scrutinized the house in front of him with close attention	O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	496
"""So she lives here"	O O O O	disgust	496
""" he muttered"	O O O	disgust	496
"""This is the place"	O O O O	disgust	496
but I can't present myself without knowing her name	O O O O O O O O O	disgust	496
"I must make some inquiries."""	O O O O O	disgust	496
It is needless to say that M	O O O O O O O	sadness	497
Fortunat was moved with sympathy	O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO	sadness	497
he always evinced a respectful sympathy for the woes of others	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	497
but in the present instance	O O O O O	sadness	497
his emotion was greatly mitigated by the satisfaction he felt at having succeeded so quickly and so completely	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	497
Madame d'Argeles had confessed everything	O O O O O	sadness	497
This was indeed a victory	O O O O O	sadness	497
for it must be admitted that he had trembled lest she should deny all	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	497
and bid him leave the house.	O O O O O O	sadness	497
The dismissal was so imperious that M	O O O O O O O	fear	499
Fortunat bowed and went off	O O O O O	fear	499
completely bewildered by this denouement	O O O O O	fear	499

""" But"	O O	fear	499
although he was disappointed and angry	O O O O O O	fear	499
he did not by any means despair	O O O O O O O	fear	499

One afternoon	O O	surprise	500
when Bruno came home from school	O O O O O O	surprise	500
he was surprised to find Maria	O O B-EMO O O O	surprise	500
the family's maid—who always kept her head bowed and never looked up from the carpet—standing in his bedroom	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	500
pulling all his belongings out of the wardrobe and packing them in four large wooden crates	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	500
even the things he'd hidden at the back that belonged to him and were nobody else's business.	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	500
'What are you doing	O O O O	sadness	501
' he asked in as polite a tone as he could muster	O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	501
for although he wasn't happy to come home and find someone going through his possessions	O O O B-EMO I-EMO O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	501
his mother had always told him that he was to treat Maria respectfully and not just imitate the Way Father spoke to her	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	501
'You take your hands off my things.'	O O O O O O O	sadness	501
Mother had walked into her own bedroom by then but Lars	O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	502
the butler	O O	sadness	502
was in there	O O O	sadness	502
packing her things too	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O	sadness	502
She sighed and threw her hands in the air in frustration before marching back to the staircase	O B-EMO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	502
followed by Bruno	O O O	sadness	502
who wasn't going to let the matter drop without an explanation.	O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	502
Bruno ran downstairs and even passed her out on the staircase so that he was waiting in the dining room when she arrived	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	503
He looked at her without saying anything for a moment and thought to himself that she couldn't have applied her make-up correctly that morning because the rims of her eyes were more red than usual	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	503
like his own after he'd been causing chaos and got into trouble and ended up crying.	O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O B-EMO	sadness	503
'What is	O O	sadness	504
' he asked	O O O	sadness	504
'Am I being sent away	O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	504
"'	'No"	O	sadness	504
not just you	O O O	sadness	504
' she said	O O O	sadness	504
looking as if she might smile for a moment but thinking better of it	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	504
We all are	O O O	sadness	504
Your father and I	O O O B-CAU	sadness	504
Gretel and you	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	504
All four of us	O O O O	sadness	504
Bruno thought about this and frowned	O O O O O B-EMO	sadness	504
He wasn't particularly bothered if Gretel was being sent away because she was a Hopeless Case and caused nothing but trouble for him	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	504
But it seemed a little unfair that they all had to go with her.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	504
He wasn't particularly bothered if Gretel was being sent away because she was a Hopeless Case and caused nothing but trouble for him	O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	505
But it seemed a little unfair that they all had to go with her.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	505
'And we all have to go too	O O O O O O O	sadness	506
' asked Bruno	O O O	sadness	506
Of course we do	O O O O	sadness	506
' said Mother	O O O	sadness	506
'You wouldn't want Father to go to his new job on his own and be lonely there	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	506
would you	O O	sadness	506
"'	'I suppose not"	O O O	sadness	506
' said Bruno	O O O	sadness	506
Father would miss us all terribly if we weren't with him	O O B-EMO O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	506
' she added.	O O O	sadness	506
Mother sighed and looked around the room as if she might never see it again	O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	507
It was a very beautiful house and had five floors in total	O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	507
if you included the basement	O O O O O	sadness	507
where Cook  made all the food and Maria and Lars sat at the table arguing with each other and calling each other names that you weren't supposed to use	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	507
And if you added in the little room at the top of the house with the slanted windows where Bruno could see right across Berlin if he stood up on his tiptoes and held onto the frame tightly.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	507
'Oh my	O O	sadness	508
' said Mother with a laugh	O O O O O O	sadness	508
although it was a strange kind of laugh because she didn't look happy and turned away from Bruno as if she didn't want him to see her face	O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	508
'Yes	O	sadness	508
Bruno	O	sadness	508
' she said	O O O	sadness	508
'It's more than a mile away	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	508
Quite a lot more than that	O O O O O O	sadness	508
in fact.'	O O	sadness	508
Bruno's eyes opened wide and his mouth  made the shape of an O	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	511
He felt his arms stretching out at his sides like they did whenever something surprised him	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	511
'You don't mean we're leaving Berlin	O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	511
' he asked	O O O	sadness	511
gasping for air as he got the words out	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	511
'I'm afraid so	O O O	sadness	511
' said Mother	O O O	sadness	511
nodding her head sadly.	O O O B-EMO	sadness	511
'Say goodbye to them	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	513
' he asked	O O O	anger	513
staring at her in surprise	O O O O O	anger	513
'Say goodbye to them	O O O O	anger	513
' he repeated	O O O	anger	513
spluttering out the words as if his mouth was full of biscuits that he'd munched into tiny pieces but not actually swallowed yet	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	513
'Say goodbye to Karl and Daniel and Martin	O O O O O O O O	anger	513
' he continued	O O O	anger	513
his voice coming dangerously close to shouting	O O O O O O B-EMO	anger	513
which	O	anger	513
was not allowed indoors	O O O O	anger	513
'But they're my three best friends for life	O O O O O O O O	anger	513
'I'm sorry	O B-EMO	sadness	514
Bruno	O	sadness	514
' said Mother	O O O	sadness	514
'but your plans are just going to have to wait	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	514
We don't have a choice in this.'	O O O O O O O	sadness	514
'Bruno	O	sadness	515
that's enough	O O	sadness	515
' she said	O O O	sadness	515
snapping at him now and standing up to show him that she was serious when she said that was enough	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	515
'Honestly	O	sadness	515
only last week you were complaining about how much things have changed here recently.'	O O O O O B-EMO O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	515
'Everyone has to do that	O O O O O	sadness	516
' said Mother	O O O	sadness	516
'It keeps us safe	O O O O	sadness	516
And who knows	O O O	sadness	516
maybe we'll be in less danger if we move away	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	516
Now	O	sadness	516
I need you to go upstairs and help Maria with your packing	O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	516
We don't have as much time to prepare as I would have liked	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	516
thanks to some people	O O O O	sadness	516
Bruno nodded and walked away sadly	O O O O O B-EMO	sadness	516
knowing that 'some people' was a grown-up's word for 'Father' and one that he wasn't supposed to use himself.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	516
When he first saw their new house Bruno's eyes opened wide	O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU O O O O	surprise	517
his mouth  made the shape of an O and his arms stretched out at his sides once again	B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	517
Everything about it seemed to be the exact opposite of their old home and he couldn't believe that they were really going to live there.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	517
But there was something about the new house that  made Bruno think that no one ever laughed there	O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O O	sadness	518
that there was nothing to laugh at and nothing to be happy about.	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	518
Bruno had a pain in his stomach and he could feel something growing inside him	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	519
something that when it worked its way up from the lowest depths inside him to the outside world would either make him shout and scream that the whole thing was wrong and unfair and a big mistake for which somebody would pay one of these days	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	519
or just make him burst into tears instead.	O O O O O O O O	anger	519
He couldn't understand how this had all come about	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	521
One day he was perfectly content	O O O O O B-EMO	happiness	521
playing at home	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	521
having three best friends for life	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	521
sliding down banisters	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	521
trying to stand on his tiptoes to see right across Berlin	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	521
and now he was stuck here in this cold	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	521
nasty house with three whispering maids and a waiter who was both unhappy and angry	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	521
where no one looked as if they could ever be cheerful again.	O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	521
'Bruno	O	sadness	522
I want you to go upstairs and unpack and I want you to do it now	O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	522
' said Mother in an unfriendly voice	O O O O O O O	sadness	522
and he knew that she meant business so he turned round and marched away without another word	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	522
He could feel tears springing up behind his eyes but he was determined that he wouldn't allow them to appear.	O O O B-EMO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	522
Just at that moment there was a creak outside in the hallway and Bruno looked up to see the door of Mother and Father's room opening slightly	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	523
He froze	O B-EMO	fear	523
unable to move for a moment	O O O O O O	fear	523
Mother was still downstairs	O O O O	fear	523
which meant that Father was in there and he might have heard everything that Bruno had just said	O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	523
He watched the door	O O O O	fear	523
hardly daring to breathe	O O O O	fear	523
wondering whether Father might come through it and take him downstairs for a serious talking-to.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	523
'One	O	fear	524
of your father's soldiers	O O O O	fear	524
I suppose	O O	fear	524
' said Maria	O O O	fear	524
who had stood up very straight when the young man appeared and held her hands before her like a person in prayer	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	524
She had stared down at the ground rather than at his face	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	524
as if she was afraid she might be turned to stone if she looked directly at him	O O O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	524
she only relaxed when he had gone	O O O O O O O	fear	524
'We'll get to know them in time.'	O O O O O O O	fear	524
'I don't see what else there is to do other than that	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	525

'I don't even think there's going to be anyone to play with other than Gretel	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	525

She's a Hopeless Case	O O O O	sadness	526
He felt as if he was about to cry again but stopped himself	O O O O O O O O B-EMO O O O O	sadness	526
not wanting to look like a baby in front of Maria	O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	526
He looked around the room without fully lifting his eyes up from the ground	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	526
trying to see whether there was anything of interest to be found.	O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	526
'Of course I did	O O O O	happiness	529

'Do you really think so	O O O O O	happiness	529
'Of course	O O	sadness	530

who always spoke of Father as if he could never do any wrong and never got angry and always came in to kiss her goodnight before she went to sleep which	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	530
if Bruno was to be really fair and not just sad about moving houses	O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU	sadness	530
he would have admitted Father did for him too.	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	530
'And I miss Hilda and Isobel and Louise	O O O O O O O O	anger	531
' said Gretel	O O O	anger	531
and Bruno tried to remember which of those three girls was the monster	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	531
'I don't think the other children look at all friendly	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	531
' said Bruno	O O O	anger	531
and Gretel immediately stopped putting one of her more terrifying dolls on a shelf and turned round to stare at him.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO	anger	531
There wasn't any grass after the fence	O O O O O O O	surprise	532
in fact there was no greenery anywhere to be seen in the distance	O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	532
Instead the ground was  made of a sand-like substance	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O	surprise	532
and as far as she could make out there was nothing but low huts and large square buildings dotted around and one or two smoke stacks in the distance	O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	532
She opened her mouth to say something	O O O O O O O	surprise	532
but when she did she realized that she couldn't find any words to express her surprise	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO	surprise	532
and so she did the only sensible thing she could think of and closed it again.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	532
'Look over there	O O O	happiness	534
' said Bruno	O O O	happiness	534
and Gretel followed the direction of the finger he was pointing and saw	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	534
emerging from a hut in the distance	O O O O O O O	happiness	534
a group of children huddled together and being shouted at by a group of soldiers	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	534
The more they were shouted at	O O O O O O	happiness	534
the closer they huddled together	O O O O O	happiness	534
but then one of the soldiers lunged towards them and they separated and seemed to do what he had wanted them to do all along	O O O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	534
which was to stand in a single line	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	534
When they did	O B-CAU I-CAU	happiness	534
the soldiers all started to laugh and applaud them.	O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O	happiness	534
'Look over there	O O O	sadness	535
' said Bruno	O O O	sadness	535
and Gretel followed the direction of the finger he was pointing and saw	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	535
emerging from a hut in the distance	O O O O O O O	sadness	535
a group of children huddled together and being shouted at by a group of soldiers	O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	535
The more they were shouted at	O O O O O O	sadness	535
the closer they huddled together	O O O O O	sadness	535
but then one of the soldiers lunged towards them and they separated and seemed to do what he had wanted them to do all along	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	535
which was to stand in a single line	O O O O O O O O	sadness	535
When they did	O O O	sadness	535
the soldiers all started to laugh and applaud them	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	535
'It must be some sort of rehearsal	O O O O O O O	sadness	535
' suggested Gretel	O O O	sadness	535
ignoring the fact that some of the children	O O O O O O O O	sadness	535
even some of the older ones	O O O O O O	sadness	535
even the ones as grown up as her	O O O O O O O O	sadness	535
looked as if they were crying.	O O O O O B-EMO	sadness	535
Bruno walked slowly down the stairs and hesitated for a moment outside the door	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	537
He felt sad that Father had not come up to say hello to him in the hour or so that he had been here	O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	537
but it had been explained to him on many occasions just how busy Father was and that he couldn't be disturbed by silly things like saying hello to him all the time	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	537
But the soldiers had left now and he thought it would be all right if he knocked on the door.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	537
'You were a help to your mother and sister in closing the house	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	538
' 'Yes	O O	happiness	538
Father	O	happiness	538
' said Bruno	O O O	happiness	538
'Then I'm proud of you	O O B-EMO O O	happiness	538
' said Father approvingly	O O O O	happiness	538
'Sit down	O O	happiness	538
boy.'	O	happiness	538
'What do I think	O O O O	sadness	539
' asked Bruno	O O O	sadness	539
'What do I think of what	O O O O O O	sadness	539
' 'Of your new home	O O O O O	sadness	539
Do you like it	O O O O	sadness	539
' 'No	O O	sadness	539
' said Bruno quickly	O O O O	sadness	539
because he always tried to be honest and knew that if he hesitated even for a moment then he wouldn't have the nerve to say what he really thought	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	539
'I think we should go home	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	539
' he added bravely	O O O O	sadness	539
Father's smile faded only a little and he glanced down at his letter for a moment before looking back up again	O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	539
as if he wanted to consider his reply carefully	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	539
'Well	O	sadness	539
we are home	O O O	sadness	539
Bruno	O	sadness	539
' he said finally in a gentle voice	O O O O O O O O	sadness	539
'Out-With is our new home.'	O O O O O	sadness	539
'I want to go home	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	541
' said Bruno	O O O	sadness	541
He could feel tears welling up behind his eyes and wanted nothing more than for Father to realize just how awful a place Out-With really was and agree that it was time to leave.	O O O B-EMO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	541
Bruno looked around	O O O	surprise	543
His gaze landed on the window in the corner of the room and through it he could see the awful landscape beyond	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	543
'Did you do something wrong	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	543
' he asked after a moment	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	543
'Something that  made the Fury angry	O O O O O O O	surprise	543
' 'Me	O O	surprise	543
' said Father	O O O	surprise	543
looking at him in surprise	O O O O B-EMO	surprise	543
'What do you mean	O O O O	surprise	543
'Did you do something bad in work	O O O O O O O	anger	546
I know that everyone says you're an important man and that the Fury has big things in mind for you	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	546
but he'd hardly send you to a place like this if you hadn't done something that he wanted to punish you for	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	546
Father laughed	O O	anger	546
which upset Bruno even more	O O O O O	anger	546
there was nothing that made him more angry than when a grown-up laughed at him for not knowing something	O O O O O O O B-EMO O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	546
especially when he was trying to find out the answer by asking questions.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	546
'I don't want to accept it	O O O O O O	surprise	548
' shouted Bruno	O O O	surprise	548
blinking in surprise because he hadn't known he was going to shout out loud.	O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	548
He tensed slightly and got ready to make a run for it if necessary	O B-EMO O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	549
But nothing seemed to be making Father angry today—and if Bruno was honest with himself he would have admitted that Father rarely became angry	O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	549
he became quiet and distant and always had his way in the end anyway—and rather than shouting at him or chasing him around the house	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	549
he simply shook his head and indicated that their debate was at an end.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	549
'Go to your room	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	550
Bruno	O	sadness	550
' he said in such a quiet voice that Bruno knew that he meant business now	O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	550
so he stood up	O O O O	sadness	550
tears of frustration forming in his eyes	B-EMO O O O O O O	sadness	550
He walked towards the door	O O O O O	sadness	550
but before opening it he turned round and asked one final question	O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	550
'Father	O	sadness	550
' he began.	O O O	sadness	550
'It's not about that	O O O O	sadness	552
' said Bruno quickly	O O O O	sadness	552
'I just have one other question	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	552
Father sighed but indicated that he should ask it and then that would be an end to the matter and no arguments.	O B-EMO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	552
'Everything here is horrible	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	558
' he said out loud	O O O O O	anger	558
even though there was no one present to hear him	O O O O O O O O O O	anger	558
but somehow it  made him feel better to hear the words stated anyway	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	558
'I hate this house	O O O O	anger	558
I hate my room and I even hate the paintwork	O O O O O O O O O O	anger	558
I hate it all	O B-EMO O O	anger	558
Absolutely everything.'	O O	anger	558
Gretel was nowhere to be found and he had begun to worry that he would go mad with boredom.	O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	559
'Well	O	happiness	561
of course it's important	O O O O	happiness	561
' said Bruno irritably	O O O O	happiness	561
as if she was just being deliberately difficult	O O O O O O O O	happiness	561
'You're part of the family	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	561
aren't you	O O	happiness	561
' 'I'm not sure whether your father would agree with that	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	561

allowing herself a smile because she was touched by what he had just said.	O O O O O O O B-EMO O O O O O O	happiness	561
'When I make mistakes I get punished	O O O O O O O	anger	562
' insisted Bruno	O O O	anger	562
irritated by the fact that the rules that always applied to children never seemed to apply to grownups at all (despite the fact that they were the ones who enforced them)	B-EMO O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	562
'Stupid Father	O O	anger	562
' he added under his breath.	O O O O O O	anger	562
'Stupid Father	B-CAU I-CAU	surprise	563
' he added under his breath	O O O O O O	surprise	563
Maria's eyes opened wide and she took a step towards him	O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O O O O O O O	surprise	563
her hands covering her mouth for a moment in horror	O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	563
She looked round to make sure that no one was listening to them and had heard what Bruno had just said	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	563
'You mustn't say that	O O O O	surprise	563
' she said	O O O	surprise	563
'You must never say something like that about your father.'	O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	563
'Because your father is a good man	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	565
' said Maria	O O O	happiness	565
'A very good man	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	565

Is that taking care of us	O O O O O O	happiness	565
' 'There are many things your father has done	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	565

'Many things of which you should be proud	O O O O O O O B-EMO	happiness	565
If it wasn't for your father	O O O O O O	happiness	565
where would I be now after all	O O O O O O O	happiness	565
'My mother knew your father when he was just a boy of your age	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	566
' said Maria after a few moments	O O O O O O O	happiness	566
'She worked for your grandmother	O O O O O	happiness	566
She was a dresser for her when she toured Germany as a younger woman	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	566
She arranged all the clothes for her concerts—washed them	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	566
ironed them	O O	happiness	566
repaired them	O O	happiness	566
Magnificent gowns	O O	happiness	566
all of them	O O O	happiness	566
And the stitching	O O O	happiness	566
Bruno	O	happiness	566
Like art work	O O O	happiness	566
every design	O O	happiness	566
You don't find dressmakers like that these days	O O O O O O O O	happiness	566
She shook her head and smiled at the memory as Bruno listened patiently	O O O O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	566
'She  made sure that they were all laid out and ready whenever your grandmother arrived in her dressing room before a show	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	566
And after your grandmother retired	O O O O O	happiness	566
of course my mother stayed friendly with her and received a small pension	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	566
but times were hard then and your father offered me a job	O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	566
the first I had ever had	O O O O O O	happiness	566
A few months later my mother became very sick and she needed a lot of hospital care and your father arranged it all	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	566
even though he was not obliged to	O O O O O O O	happiness	566
He paid for it out of his own pocket because she had been a friend to his mother	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	566
And he took me into his household for the same reason	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	566
And when she died he paid all the expenses for her funeral too	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	566
So don't you ever call your father stupid	O O O O O O O O	happiness	566
Bruno	O	happiness	566
Not around me	O O O	happiness	566
I won't allow it.'	O O O O	happiness	566
Bruno bit his lip	O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO	sadness	567
He had hoped that Maria would take his side in the campaign to get away from Out-With but he could see where her loyalties really lay	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	567
And he had to admit that he was rather proud of his father when he heard that story.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	567
Bruno recognized footsteps pounding up the stairs towards them	O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	571
quicker and quicker	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	571
and he crawled back on the bed	O O O O O O O	fear	571
pressing himself against the wall	O O O O O	fear	571
suddenly afraid of what was going to happen next	O O O O O O O O O	fear	571
He held his breath	O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO	fear	571
expecting trouble	O O	fear	571
but it was only Gretel	O O O O O	fear	571
the Hopeless Case.	O O O	fear	571
She poked her head through the doorway and seemed surprised to find her brother and the family maid engaged in conversation.	O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	572
'Because she's the maid	O O O O	anger	574

'That's what she's here for	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	574
'That's not what she's here for	O O O O O O	anger	574

standing up and marching over to her	O O O B-EMO O O O	anger	574
'She's not just here to do things for us all the time	O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	574
you know	O O	anger	574
Especially things that we can do ourselves.'	O O O O O O O	anger	574
'I still think he's  made a terrible mistake	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	575
' said Bruno quietly after a few minutes when he felt as if he wanted to apologize for his sister's behaviour but didn't know whether that was the right thing to do or not	O O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	575
Situations like that always  made Bruno feel very uncomfortable because	O O O O O O O O B-EMO O O	sadness	575
in his heart	O O O	sadness	575
he knew that there was no reason to be impolite to someone	O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	575
even if they did work for you	O O O O O O O	sadness	575
There was such a thing as manners after all.	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	575
'No	O	fear	577

her voice becoming grating now as she appealed to him	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	577
'Just keep quiet about it	O O O O O	fear	577
Bruno	O	fear	577

There was something in her eyes	O O O O O O	fear	577
a sort of frenzied worry	O O O O B-EMO	fear	577
that he had never seen there before and that unsettled him.	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	577
In the distance he could see the gate that led to the road that led to the train station that led home	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	578
but the idea of going there	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	578
the idea of running away and being left on his own without anyone at all	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	578
was even more unpleasant to him than the idea of staying.	O O O B-EMO O O O O O O O	sadness	578
Several weeks after Bruno arrived at Out-With with his family and with no prospect of a visit on the horizon from either Karl or Daniel or Martin	O O O O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	579

Lieutenant Kotler was deep in conversation with Gretel and whatever he was saying must have been terribly funny because she was laughing loudly and twirling her hair around her fingers into ringlets	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	585

'I don't want anything	O O O O	anger	585
' snapped Bruno	O O O	anger	585
glaring at her	O O O	anger	585
'I just came over to say hello.'	O O O O O O O	anger	585
'Stop it	O O	anger	587
Kurt	O	anger	587
' said Gretel	O O O	anger	587
drying her eyes	O O O	anger	587
'He doesn't understand you	O O O O	anger	587
He's only nine	O O O	anger	587
'Oh	O	anger	587
will you be quiet please	O O O O O	anger	587
' shouted Bruno	O O O	anger	587
staring at his sister in irritation	O O O O O B-EMO	anger	587
It was bad enough having to come out here and ask for a favour from Lieutenant Kotler	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	587
but it only  made things worse when his own sister teased him all the way through it.	O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O	anger	587
'Indeed	O	happiness	588
' said Lieutenant Kotler	O O O O	happiness	588
nodding his head wisely as if such things were only distant memories to him now	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	588
despite the fact that he was	O O O O O O	happiness	588
as Gretel had pointed out	O O O O O	happiness	588
no more than a teenager himself	O O O O O O	happiness	588
'Yes	O	happiness	588
I made many swings myself when I was a child	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	588
My friends and I had many happy afternoons together playing on them.'	O O O O O O B-EMO O O O O O	happiness	588
'Indeed	O	surprise	589
' said Lieutenant Kotler	O O O O	surprise	589
nodding his head wisely as if such things were only distant memories to him now	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	589
despite the fact that he was	O O O O O O	surprise	589
as Gretel had pointed out	O O O O O	surprise	589
no more than a teenager himself	O O O O O O	surprise	589
'Yes	O	surprise	589

My friends and I had many happy afternoons together playing on them	O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	589
Bruno felt astonished that he could have anything in common with him (and even more surprised to learn that Lieutenant Kotler had ever had friends)	O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	589
'So what do you think	O O O O O	surprise	589
' he asked	O O O	surprise	589
'Are there any around	O O O O	surprise	589
'Well	O	surprise	593
how do you know	O O O O	surprise	593
' asked Bruno quickly	O O O O	surprise	593
growing irritable now despite the fact that this was the same man who had come out to pick him up off the ground and brought him in and taken care of him	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	593
'You're not a doctor	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	593
Pavel stopped peeling the carrots for a moment and looked across the table at Bruno	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	593
his head held low	O O O O	surprise	593
his eyes looking up	O O O O	surprise	593
as if he were wondering what to say to such a thing	O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	593
He sighed and seemed to consider it for quite a long time before saying	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	593
'Yes I am	O B-CAU I-CAU	surprise	593
Bruno stared at him in surprise	O O O O O B-EMO	surprise	593
This didn't make any sense to him	O O O O O O O	surprise	593
'But you're a waiter	O O O O	surprise	593
' he said slowly	O O O O	surprise	593
'And you peel the vegetables for dinner	O O O O O O O	surprise	593
How can you be a doctor too	O O O O O O O	surprise	593
Pavel turned his body slightly in their direction but didn't lift his head	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	594
'The wound has been cleaned	B-CAU I-CAU O O O	fear	594
' he said quietly	O O O O	fear	594
not answering Bruno's question	O O O O	fear	594
'There's nothing to worry about.'	O O O B-EMO O	fear	594
'Don't argue with me—go to your room	O O O O O O O	happiness	595
' she insisted	O O O	happiness	595
and Bruno stepped off the chair	O O O O O O	happiness	595
putting his weight on what he had decided to call his bad leg	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	595
and it hurt a little	O O O O O	happiness	595
He turned and left the room but was still able to hear Mother saying thank you to Pavel as he walked towards the stairs	O O O O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	595
and this  made Bruno happy because surely it was obvious to everyone that if it hadn't been for him	O O O O B-EMO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	595
he would have bled to death.	O O O O O O	happiness	595
Grandfather had spent his entire life running a restaurant in the centre of town	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	596
and one of his employees was the father of Bruno's friend Martin who worked there as a chef	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	596
Although Grandfather no longer cooked or waited on tables in the restaurant himself	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	596
he spent most of his days there	O O O O O O O	happiness	596
sitting at the bar in the afternoon talking to the customers	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	596
eating his meals there in the evening and staying until closing time	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	596
laughing with his friends.	B-EMO O O O	happiness	596
Father always stayed to listen and Bruno did too because there was nothing he liked more than hearing Grandmother break into her full voice and soak up the applause of the guests at the end	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O B-EMO O O O O O O	happiness	597
Plus	O	happiness	597
La Vie en Rose gave him chills and  made the tiny hairs on the back of his neck stand on end.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	597
Grandfather was very proud of his son when he saw him in his new uniform but Grandmother was the only one who seemed unimpressed	O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O O	sadness	600
After dinner had been served	O O O O O	sadness	600
and after she and Gretel and Bruno had performed their latest production	O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	600
she sat down sadly in one of the armchairs and looked at Father	O O O B-EMO O O O O O O O O O	sadness	600
shaking her head as if he were a huge disappointment to her.	O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	600
'He did come to harm	O O O O O	happiness	601
Matthias	O	happiness	601
' insisted Grandmother	O O O	happiness	601
'Take a look at him for your evidence	O O O O O O O O	happiness	601
'And now look at you	O O O O O	happiness	601
' continued Grandfather	O O O	happiness	601
ignoring her	O O	happiness	601
'It makes me so proud to see you elevated to such a responsible position	O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	601
Helping your country reclaim her pride after all the great wrongs that were done to her	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	601
The punishments above and beyond—''Oh	O O O O O	happiness	601
will you listen to yourself	O O O O O	happiness	601
' cried Grandmother	O O O	happiness	601
'Which one of you is the most foolish	O O O O O O O O	happiness	601
I wonder	O O	happiness	601
'That's all you soldiers are interested in anyway	O O O O O O O O	anger	603
' Grandmother said	O O O	anger	603
ignoring the children altogether	O O O O	anger	603
'Looking handsome in your fine uniforms	O O O O O O	anger	603
Dressing up and doing the terrible	O O O O O O	anger	603
terrible things you do	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	603
It makes me ashamed	O O O O	anger	603
But I blame myself	O O B-EMO O	anger	603
Ralf	O	anger	603
not you.'	O O	anger	603
Bruno hadn't seen much of Grandmother after that and hadn't even had a chance to say goodbye to her before they moved to Out-With	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	604
but he missed her very much and decided to write her a letter.	O O B-EMO O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	604
The walk along the fence took Bruno a lot longer than he expected	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	605
it seemed to stretch on and on for several miles	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	605
He walked and walked	O O O O	sadness	605
and when he looked back the house that he was living in became smaller and smaller until it vanished from sight altogether	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	605
During all this time he never saw anyone anywhere close to the fence	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	605
nor did he find any doors to let him inside	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	605
and he started to despair that his exploration was going to be entirely unsuccessful	O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	605
In fact although the fence continued as far as the eye could see	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	605
the huts and buildings and smoke stacks were disappearing in the distance behind him and the fence seemed to be separating him from nothing but open space.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	605
Shmuel thought about it and looked down at his fingers and they wiggled in the air	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	607
as if he was trying to calculate	O O O O O O O	surprise	607
'I'm nine	O O	surprise	607
' he said	O O O	surprise	607
'My birthday is April the fifteenth nineteen thirty-four	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	607
Bruno stared at him in surprise	O O O O O B-EMO	surprise	607
'What did you say	O O O O	surprise	607
' he asked	O O O	surprise	607
'I said my birthday is April the fifteenth nineteen thirty-four.'	O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	607
Bruno's eyes opened wide and his mouth  made the shape of an O	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	608
'I don't believe it	O O O O	surprise	608
' he said	O O O	surprise	608
'Why not	O O	surprise	608
' asked Shmuel	O O O	surprise	608
'No	O	surprise	608
' said Bruno	O O O	surprise	608
shaking his head quickly	O O O O	surprise	608
'I don't mean I don't believe you	O O O O O O O	surprise	608
I mean I'm surprised	O O O B-EMO	surprise	608
that's all	O O	surprise	608
Because my birthday is April the fifteenth too.	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	608
'Do you have many friends	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	609
' asked Bruno	O O O	sadness	609
cocking his head a little to the side as he waited for an answer	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	609
'Oh yes	B-CAU I-CAU	sadness	609
' said Shmuel	O O O	sadness	609
'Well	O	sadness	609
sort of	O O	sadness	609
Bruno frowned	O B-EMO	sadness	609
He had hoped that Shmuel might have said no as it would give them something else in common	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	609
' Close friends	O O O	sadness	609
' he asked.	O O O	sadness	609
'The Fury has something he wants to discuss with me	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	610
' said Father	O O O	surprise	610
who was allowed to interrupt Mother even if no one else was	O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	610
I just got a phone call this afternoon	O O O O O O O O	surprise	610
The only time he can make it is Thursday evening and he's invited himself to dinner	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	610
Mother's eyes opened wide and her mouth  made the shape of an O	O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O	surprise	610
Bruno stared at her and wondered whether this was what he looked like when he was surprised about something.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	610
An hour before the Fury was due to arrive Gretel and Bruno were brought downstairs	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	611
where they received a rare invitation into Father's office	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	611
Gretel was wearing a white dress and knee socks and her hair had been twisted into corkscrew curls	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	611
Bruno was wearing a pair of dark brown shorts	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	611
a plain white shirt and a dark brown tie	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	611
He had a new pair of shoes for the occasion and was very proud of them	O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O B-EMO O O	happiness	611
even though they were too small for him and were pinching his feet and making it difficult for him to walk	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	611
All these preparations and fine clothes seemed a little extravagant	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	611
all the same	O O O	happiness	611
because Bruno and Gretel weren't even invited to dinner	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	611
they had eaten an hour earlier.	O O O O O O	happiness	611
The woman standing beside him	O O O O O	fear	612
however	O	fear	612
was quite the most beautiful woman he had ever seen in his life	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	612
She had blonde hair and very red lips	O O O O O O O O	fear	612
and while the Fury spoke to Mother she turned and looked at Bruno and smiled	O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	612
making him go red with embarrassment.	O O O O O B-EMO	fear	612
The matter was resolved quickly	O O O O O	fear	613
however	O	fear	613
as the Fury	O B-CAU I-CAU	fear	613
who was the rudest guest Bruno had ever witnessed	O O O O O O O O O	fear	613
turned round and walked directly into the dining room and promptly sat down at the head of the table—in Father's seat	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	613
—without another word	O B-CAU I-CAU	fear	613
A little flustered	O O B-EMO	fear	613
Mother and Father followed him inside and Mother gave instructions to Lars that he could start heating up the soup.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	613
'We wore the armbands for a few months	O O O O O O O O	happiness	615
' he said	O O O	happiness	615
'And then things changed again	O O O O O	happiness	615
I came home one day and Mama said we couldn't live in our house any more—' 'That happened to me too	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	615
' shouted Bruno	O O O	happiness	615
delighted that he wasn't the only boy who'd been forced to move.	B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	615
'We lived there for some more months	O O O O O O O	disgust	617
' continued Shmuel	O O O	disgust	617
'all of us in that one room	O O O O O O O	disgust	617
There was one small window in it but I didn't like to look out of it because then I would see the wall and I hated the wall because our real home was on the other side of it	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	617
And this part of town was the bad part because it was always noisy and it was impossible to sleep	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	617
And I hated Luka	O O B-EMO O	disgust	617
who was the boy who kept hitting me even when I did nothing wrong.'	O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	617
Bruno was about to leave when the food caught his eye and a question came into his mind that had been bothering him for some time	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	618
He hadn't been able to think of anyone to ask before	O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	618
but this seemed like a perfect moment and the perfect person	O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	618
'Maria	O	surprise	618
' he said	O O O	surprise	618
'can I ask you a question	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	618
' The maid turned round and looked at him in surprise	O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO	surprise	618
'Of course	O O	surprise	618
Master Bruno	O O	surprise	618
' she said.	O O O	surprise	618
'He said he was a doctor	O O O O O O	happiness	619

'Which didn't seem right at all	O O O O O O	happiness	619
He's not a doctor	O O O O	happiness	619
is he	O O	happiness	619
' 'No	O O	happiness	619

shaking her head	O O O	happiness	619
'No	O	happiness	619
he's not a doctor	O O O O	happiness	619
He's a waiter	O O O	happiness	619
'I knew it	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	619

feeling very pleased with himself	O O B-EMO O O	happiness	619
'Why did he lie to me then	O O O O O O O	happiness	619
It doesn't make any sense.'	O O O O O	happiness	619
Later that evening Bruno was disappointed to find that Lieutenant Kotler was joining him	O O O O O B-EMO O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	620
Mother	O	sadness	620
Father and Gretel for dinner	O O O B-CAU I-CAU	sadness	620
Pavel was wearing his white jacket as usual and served them as they ate.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	620
'Herr Liszt won't let us read poetry or plays	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	621
' complained Bruno during the main course	O B-EMO O O O O O	sadness	621
As they had company for dinner	O O O O O O	sadness	621
the family were dressed formally—Father in his uniform	O O O O O O O O	sadness	621
Mother in a green dress that set off her eyes	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	621
and Gretel and Bruno in the clothes they wore to church when they lived in Berlin	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	621
'I asked him if we could read them just one day a week but he said no	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	621
not while he was in charge of our education.'	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	621
'I enjoyed history very much when I was a boy	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	622
' said Lieutenant Kotler after a few silent moments	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	622
'And although my father was a professor of literature at the university	O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	622
I preferred the social sciences to the arts	O O O O O O O O	sadness	622
'I didn't know that	O O O O	sadness	622

turning to look at him for a moment	O O O O O O O O	sadness	622
'Does he still teach then	O O O O O	sadness	622
' 'I suppose so	O O O O	sadness	622
' said Lieutenant Kotler	O O O O	sadness	622
'I don't really know	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	622
'Well	O	sadness	622
how could you not know	O O O O O	sadness	622

frowning at him	B-EMO O O	sadness	622
'Don't you keep in touch with him	O O O O O O O	sadness	622
'I asked you where he went	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	623
' he repeated	O O O	fear	623
'Your father	O O	fear	623
The professor of literature	O O O O	fear	623
Where did he go when he left Germany	O O O O O O O O	fear	623
' Lieutenant Kotler's face grew a little red and he stuttered somewhat as he spoke	O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O O O O	fear	623
I believe… I believe he is currently in Switzerland	O O O O O O O O O	fear	623
' he said finally	O O O O	fear	623
'The last I heard he was teaching at a university in Berne.'	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	623
Bruno watched him	O O O	anger	625
hoping he was feeling all right	O O O O O O	anger	625
although he managed to release the cork without any accidents	O O O O O O O O O O	anger	625
But after he had filled Father's glass and turned to refill Lieutenant Kotler's	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	625
he lost his grip of the bottle somehow and it fell crashing	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	625
glug-glug-glugging its contents out directly onto the young man's lap	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	625
What happened then was both unexpected and extremely unpleasant	O O O O O O O O O	anger	625
Lieutenant Kotler grew very angry with Pavel and no one—not Bruno	O O O O B-EMO O O O O O O	anger	625

not Mother and not even Father—stepped in to stop him doing what he did next	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	625
even though none of them could watch	O O O O O O O	anger	625
Even though it  made Bruno cry and Gretel grow pale.	O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	625
'I'm reading	O O	anger	627
' said Bruno	O O O	anger	627
'What are you reading	O O O O	anger	627
' she asked him	O O O O	anger	627
and rather than answer he simply turned the cover towards her so she could see for herself	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	627
She  made a raspberry sound through her lips and some of her spit landed on Bruno's face	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	627
'Boring	B-CAU	anger	627
' she said in a sing-song voice	O O O O O O O	anger	627
'It's not boring at all	O O O O O	anger	627

'It's an adventure	O O O	anger	627
It's better than dolls	O O O O	anger	627
that's for sure	O O O	anger	627
Gretel didn't rise to the bait on that one	O O O O O O O O O	anger	627
'What are you doing	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	627
' she repeated	O B-CAU I-CAU	anger	627
irritating Bruno even further	O O O O	anger	627
I told you	O O O	anger	627
I'm trying to read	O O O O	anger	627
' he said in a grumpy voice	O O O O O B-EMO O	anger	627
'If some people would just let me.'	O O O O O O O	anger	627
'I hate the rain too	O O O O O	anger	629
' he said	O O O	anger	629
'I should be with Shmuel by now	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	629
He'll think I've forgotten him	O O O O O	anger	629
The words were out of his mouth quicker than he could stop them and he felt a pain in his stomach and grew furious with himself for saying that.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O O O O O	anger	629
'Who did you say you should be with	O O O O O O O O	anger	630
' she shouted	O O O	anger	630
leaning forward so there could be no mistake this time	O O O O O O O O O O	anger	630
'I never said I should be with anyone	O O O O O O O O	anger	630
' he said	O O O	anger	630
'Yes	O	anger	630
you did	O O	anger	630

'Pardon	B-CAU	anger	630
' 'Bruno	O O	anger	630

He thought of the time he had forgotten to lock the bathroom door and Grandmother had walked in and seen everything	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	632
He thought of the time he had put his hand up in class and called the teacher 'Mother' and everyone had laughed at him	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	632
He thought of the time he'd fallen off his bicycle in front of a group of girls when he was trying to do a special trick and cut his knee and cried.	O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O B-EMO	sadness	632

Bruno smiled because he knew two things	O B-EMO O O O O O	happiness	633
The first was that he had got away with his lie and the second was that if anyone was the Hopeless Case around here	O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	633

Bruno got to the end of his sentence and realized that his voice had gone very quiet	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	637
These were things that Shmuel had told him	O O O O O O O O	sadness	637

Bruno gasped	O B-EMO	happiness	639
'Do you have one	O O O O	happiness	639

picturing her at another part of the fence	O O O O O O O O	happiness	639
talking to a girl her own age	O O O O O O O	happiness	639
the two of them being sarcastic together for hours at a time.	O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	639
For several weeks the rain was on and off and on and off and Bruno and Shmuel did not see as much of each other as they would have liked	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	640
When they did meet Bruno found that he was starting to worry about his friend because he seemed to be getting even thinner by the day and his face was growing more and more grey.	O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	640
Seething with anger	O O O	surprise	642
Bruno went into the kitchen and got the biggest surprise of his life	O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O O O	surprise	642
There	O	surprise	642
sitting at the table	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	642
a long way from the other side of the fence	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	642
was Shmuel	B-CAU I-CAU	surprise	642
Bruno could barely believe his eyes.	O O O O O O	surprise	642
Shmuel looked up and his terrified face broke into a broad smile when he saw his friend standing there	O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	643
'Bruno	O	fear	643
' he said.	O O O	fear	643
'I'm very glad you're here	O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU	happiness	645
' he said	O O O	happiness	645
speaking with his mouth full	O O O O O	happiness	645
'If only you didn't have to polish the glasses	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	645
I could show you my room	O O O O O O	happiness	645
'He told me not to move from this seat or there'd be trouble.'	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	645
Shmuel looked as if he wasn't really listening	O O O O O O O O	sadness	646
instead his eyes were focused on the slices of chicken and stuffing that Bruno was throwing casually into his mouth	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	646
After a moment Bruno realized what he was looking at and immediately felt guilty	O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO	sadness	646
I'm sorry	O O	sadness	646
Shmuel	O	sadness	646
' he said quickly	O O O O	sadness	646
'I should have given you some chicken too	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	646
Are you hungry	O O O	sadness	646
'No	O	sadness	647
if he comes back—' said Shmuel	O O O O O O	sadness	647
shaking his head quickly and looking back and forth towards the door	O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	647
'If who comes back	O O O O	sadness	647
You don't mean Lieutenant Kotler	O O O O O	sadness	647
' 'I'm just supposed to be cleaning the glasses	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	647
' he said	O O O	sadness	647
looking at the bowl of water in front of him in despair and then looking back at the slices of chicken that Bruno held out to him.	O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	647
'He's not going to mind	O O O O O	sadness	649
' said Bruno	O O O	sadness	649
who was confused by how anxious Shmuel seemed	O O O O O O O O	sadness	649
'It's only food	O O O	sadness	649
'I can't	O O	sadness	649
' said Shmuel	O O O	sadness	649
shaking his head and looking as if he was going to cry	O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO	sadness	649
'He'll come back	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	649
I know he will	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	649
' he continued	O O O	sadness	649
his sentences running quickly together	O O O O O	sadness	649
'I should have eaten them when you offered them	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	649

if I take them he'll come in and—'	O O O O O O O O	sadness	649
'Shmuel	O	happiness	650
Here	O	happiness	650
' said Bruno	O O O	happiness	650
stepping forward and putting the slices in his friend's hand	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	650
'Just eat them	O O O	happiness	650
There's lots left for our tea—you don't have to worry about that	O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	650
The boy stared at the food in his hand for a moment and then looked up at Bruno with wide and grateful but terrified eyes	O O O O O B-CAU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O O O	happiness	650
He threw one more glance in the direction of the door and then seemed to make a decision	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	650
because he thrust all three slices into his mouth in one go and gobbled them down in twenty seconds flat.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	650
'You have been eating	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	651
' insisted Lieutenant Kotler	O O O O	anger	651
'Did you steal something from that fridge	O O O O O O O	anger	651
' Shmuel opened his mouth and closed it	O O O O O O O O	anger	651
He opened it again and tried to find words	O O O O O O O O O	anger	651
but there were none	O O O O	anger	651
He looked towards Bruno	O O O O	anger	651
his eyes pleading for help	O O O O O	anger	651
'Answer me	O O	anger	651
' shouted Lieutenant Kotler	O B-EMO O O	anger	651
'Did you steal something from that fridge	O O O O O O O	anger	651
Bruno hadn't seen his grandmother since leaving Berlin but he had thought about her every day	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	655
The things he remembered most about her were the productions that she and he and Gretel performed at Christmas and birthdays and how she always had the perfect costume to suit whatever role he played	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	655
When he thought that they would never be able to do that again it  made him very sad indeed.	O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O B-EMO O O	sadness	655
The two days they spent in Berlin were also very sad ones	O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	656
There was the funeral	O O O O	sadness	656
and Bruno and Gretel and Father and Mother and Grandfather sat in the front row	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	656
Father wearing his most impressive uniform	O O O O O O	sadness	656
the starched and pressed one with the decorations	O O O O O O O O	sadness	656
Father was particularly sad	O O O B-EMO	sadness	656
Mother told Bruno	O O O	sadness	656
because he had fought with Grandmother and they hadn't  made it up before she died.	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O	sadness	656
There were a lot of wreaths delivered to the church and Father was proud of the fact that one of them had been sent by the Fury	O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	657
but when Mother heard she said that Grandmother would turn in her grave if she knew it was there.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	657
There was also the fact that Lieutenant Kotler had been transferred away from Out-With and wasn't around to make Bruno feel angry and upset all the time	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	658
(His departure had come about very suddenly and there had been a lot of shouting between Father and Mother about it late at night	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	658
but he was gone	O O O O	happiness	658
that was for sure	O O O O	happiness	658
and he wasn't coming back	O O O O O	happiness	658
Gretel was inconsolable	O O O	happiness	658
That was something else to be happy about: no one called him 'little man' any more.	O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	658
He enjoyed walking along the fence every afternoon and was pleased to see that his friend seemed a lot happier these days and his eyes didn't seem so sunken	O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	659
although his body was still ridiculously skinny and his face unpleasantly grey.	O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	659
'No	O	happiness	660
' said Bruno	O O O	happiness	660
'I don't understand why we're not allowed on the other side of it	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	660
What's so wrong with us that we can't go over there and play	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	660
' Gretel stared at him and then suddenly started laughing	O O O O O O O O O B-EMO	happiness	660
only stopping when she saw that Bruno was being perfectly serious.	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	660
'We're the opposite	O O O	happiness	661
' said Gretel	O O O	happiness	661
answering quickly and sounding a lot more satisfied with this answer	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	661
'Yes	O	happiness	661
that's it	O O	happiness	661
We're the opposite	O O O	happiness	661
'All right	O O	happiness	661
' said Bruno	O O O	happiness	661
pleased that he had it settled in his head at last	B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	661
'And the Opposite live on this side of the fence and the Jews live on that.'	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	661
It turned out that both Gretel and Bruno had lice in their hair	O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	663
and Gretel had to be treated with a special shampoo that smelled horrible and afterwards she sat in her room for hours on end	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	663
crying her eyes out.	B-EMO O O O	sadness	663
Bruno had the shampoo as well	O O O O O O	sadness	664
but then Father decided that the best thing was for him to start afresh and he got a razor and shaved all Bruno's hair off	O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	664
which  made Bruno cry	O O O B-EMO O	sadness	664
It didn't take long and he hated seeing all his hair float down from his head and land on the floor at his feet	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	664
but Father said it had to be done.	O O O O O O O O	sadness	664
When he saw his friend the next day Shmuel started to laugh at Bruno's appearance	O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	667
which didn't do a lot for his dwindling self-confidence	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	667
'I look just like you now	O O O O O O	sadness	667
' said Bruno sadly	O O O B-EMO	sadness	667
as if this was a terrible thing to admit.	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	667
Over the course of the next few weeks Mother seemed increasingly unhappy with life at Out-With and Bruno understood perfectly well why that might be	O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	668
After all	O O	happiness	668
when they'd first arrived he had hated it	O O O O O O O O	happiness	668
due to the fact that it was nothing like home and lacked such things as three best friends for life	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	668
But that had changed for him over time	O O O O O O O O	happiness	668
mostly due to Shmuel	O O O O	happiness	668
who had become more important to him than Karl or Daniel or Martin had ever been	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	668
But Mother didn't have a Shmuel of her own	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	668
There was no one for her to talk to	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	668
and the only person who she had been remotely friendly with—the young Lieutenant Kotler—had been transferred somewhere else.	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	668
But on the other hand he'd grown used to life at Out-With: he didn't mind Herr Liszt	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	669
he'd become much friendlier with Maria than he ever had been back in Berlin	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	669
Gretel was still going through a phase and keeping out of his way (and she didn't seem to be quite so much of a Hopeless Case any more) and his afternoon conversations with Shmuel filled him with happiness.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O B-EMO	happiness	669
Nothing at all changed for a few weeks	O O O O O O O O	fear	670
life went on as normal	O O O O O	fear	670
Father spent most of his time either in his office or on the other side of the fence	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	670
Mother kept very quiet during the day and was having an awful lot more of her afternoon naps	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	670
some of them not even in the afternoon but before lunch	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	670
and Bruno was worried for her health because he'd never known anyone need quite so many medicinal sherries	O O O B-EMO O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	670

Next morning Camaralzaman woke up before the bird left its perch	O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	741
and no sooner did it take flight than he followed it again with as little success as the previous day	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	741
only stopping to eat some herbs and fruit he found by the way	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	741
In this fashion he spent ten days	O O O O O O O	sadness	741
following the bird all day and spending the night at the foot of a tree	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	741
whilst it roosted on the topmost bough	O O O O O O O	sadness	741
On the eleventh day the bird and the prince reached a large town	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	741
and as soon as they were close to its walls the bird took a sudden and higher flight and was shortly completely out of sight	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	741
whilst Camaralzaman felt in despair at having to give up all hopes of ever recovering the talisman of the Princess Badoura.	O O O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	741

She called her women and asked if they knew where he was	O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	742
and whilst they were telling her that they had seen him enter the tent	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	742
but had not noticed his leaving it	O O O O O O O	surprise	742
she took up her belt and perceived that the little pouch was open and the talisman gone.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	742
She at once concluded that her husband had taken it and would shortly bring it back	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	744
She waited for him till evening rather impatiently	O O O O O O O O	fear	744
and wondering what could have kept him from her so long	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	744
When night came without him she felt in despair and abused the talisman and its maker roundly	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	744
In spite of her grief and anxiety however	O O O O O O B-EMO O	fear	744
she did not lose her presence of mind	O O O O O O O O	fear	744
but decided on a courageous	O O O O O	fear	744
though very unusual step.	O O O O	fear	744
The prince	O O	surprise	745
who had watched the whole scene with much interest	O O O O O O O O O	surprise	745
now drew near the spot where it happened	O O O O O O O O	surprise	745
and glancing at the dead bird he noticed something red lying near which had evidently fallen out of its inside	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	745
He picked it up	O O O O	surprise	745
and what was his surprise when he recognised the Princess Badoura's talisman which had been the cause of many misfortunes	O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	745
It would be impossible to describe his joy	O O O O O O O O	surprise	745
he kissed the talisman repeatedly	O O O O O	surprise	745
wrapped it up	O O O	surprise	745
and carefully tied it round his arm	O O O O O O O	surprise	745
For the first time since his separation from the princess he had a good night	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	745
and next morning he was up at day-break and went cheerfully to ask what work he should do.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	745
He then led the gardener to the cave	O O O O O O O O	happiness	746
and having shown him the treasure stored up there	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	746
said how happy it made him that Heaven should in this way reward his kind host's many virtues and compensate him for the privations of many years.

It may well be believed that the prince felt in despair at this fresh misfortune	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	747
which obliged him to spend another year in a strange and distasteful country	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	747
Moreover	O	fear	747
he had once more lost the Princess Badoura's talisman	O O O O O O O O O	fear	747
which he feared he might never see again	O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	747
There was nothing left for him but to hire the garden as the old man had done	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	747
and to live on in the cottage	O O O O O O O	fear	747
As he could not well cultivate the garden by himself	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	747
he engaged a lad to help him	O O O O O O O	fear	747
and to secure the rest of the treasure he put the remaining gold dust into fifty more jars	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	747
filling them up with olives so as to have them ready for transport.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	747

an elephant	O O	fear	759

instead of passing the tree I was in	O O O O O O O O	fear	759

I had indeed good reason for my terror when	O O O O O O O O O	fear	759
an instant later	O O O	fear	759
the largest of the animals wound his trunk round the stem of my tree	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	759
and with one mighty effort tore it up by the roots	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	759
bringing me to the ground entangled in its branches	O O O O O O O O O	fear	759
I thought now that my last hour was surely come	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	759
but the huge creature	O O O O	fear	759
picking me up gently enough	O O O O O	fear	759
set me upon its back	O O O O O	fear	759
where I clung more dead than alive	O O O O O O O	fear	759

It seemed to me a long time before I was once more set upon my feet by the elephant	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	759

recovering myself	O O	fear	759
I looked about me	O O O O	fear	759

Upon it is traced in white lines the figure of a man	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	762
The rhinoceros fights with the elephant	O O O O O O	fear	762
and transfixing him with his horn carries him off upon his head	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	762
but becoming blinded with the blood of his enemy	O O O O O O O O O	fear	762
he falls helpless to the ground	O O O O O O	fear	762
and then comes the roc	O O O O O	fear	762
and clutches them both up in his talons and takes them to feed his young	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	762
This doubtless astonishes you	O O O O	fear	762
but if you do not believe my tale go to Rohat and see for yourself	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	762
For fear of wearying you I pass over in silence many other wonderful things which we saw in this island	O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	762
Before we left I exchanged one of my diamonds for much goodly merchandise by which I profited greatly on our homeward way	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	762
At last we reached Balsora	O O O O O	fear	762
whence I hastened to Bagdad	O O O O O	fear	762
where my first action was to bestow large sums of money upon the poor	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	762
after which I settled down to enjoy tranquilly the riches I had gained with so much toil and pain.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	762
At this I was greatly surprised	O O O O O B-EMO	surprise	763
but looking carefully at him I recognised him to be the captain of the ship upon which I had made my second voyage	O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	763
though he had altered much since that time	O O O O O O O O	surprise	763
As for him	O O O	surprise	763
believing me to be dead it was no wonder that he had not recognised me.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	763
At daylight we wandered inland	O O O O O	fear	764
and soon saw some huts	O O O O O	fear	764
to which we directed our steps	O O O O O O	fear	764
As we drew near their black inhabitants swarmed out in great numbers and surrounded us	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	764
and we were led to their houses	O O O O O O O	fear	764
and as it were divided among our captors	O O O O O O O O	fear	764
I with five others was taken into a hut	O O O O O O O O O	fear	764
where we were made to sit upon the ground	O O O O O O O O O	fear	764
and certain herbs were given to us	O O O O O O O	fear	764
which the blacks made signs to us to eat	O O O O O O O O O	fear	764
Observing that they themselves did not touch them	O O O O O O O O	fear	764
I was careful only to pretend to taste my portion	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	764
but my companions	O O O	fear	764
being very hungry	O O O	fear	764
rashly ate up all that was set before them	O O O O O O O O O	fear	764
and very soon I had the horror of seeing them become perfectly mad	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	764
Though they chattered incessantly I could not understand a word they said	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	764
nor did they heed when I spoke to them	O O O O O O O O O	fear	764
The savages now produced large bowls full of rice prepared with cocoanut oil	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	764
of which my crazy comrades ate eagerly	O O O O O O O	fear	764
but I only tasted a few grains	O O O O O O O	fear	764
understanding clearly that the object of our captors was to fatten us speedily for their own eating	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	764
and this was exactly what happened	O O O O O O	fear	764
My unlucky companions having lost their reason	O O O O O O O	fear	764
felt neither anxiety nor fear	O O O O O	fear	764
and ate greedily all that was offered them	O O O O O O O O	fear	764
So they were soon fat and there was an end of them	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	764
but I grew leaner day by day	O O O O O O O	fear	764
for I ate but little	O O O O O	fear	764
and even that little did me no good by reason of my fear of what lay before me	O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	764
However	O	fear	764
as I was so far from being a tempting morsel	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	764
I was allowed to wander about freely	O O O O O O O	fear	764
and one day	O O O	fear	764
when all the blacks had gone off upon some expedition leaving only an old man to guard me	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	764
I managed to escape from him and plunged into the forest	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	764
running faster the more he cried to me to come back	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	764
until I had completely distanced him.	O O O O O O	fear	764
Hindbad was not a little surprised at this summons	O O O O O O O O O	fear	765
and feared that his unguarded words might have drawn upon him the displeasure of Sindbad	O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	765
so he tried to excuse himself upon the pretext that he could not leave the burden which had been entrusted to him in the street	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	765
However the lackey promised him that it should be taken care of	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	765
and urged him to obey the call so pressingly that at last the porter was obliged to yield.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	765
From time to time we landed at various islands	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	766
where we sold or exchanged our merchandise	O O O O O O O	sadness	766
and one day	O O O	sadness	766
when the wind dropped suddenly	O O O O O	sadness	766
we found ourselves becalmed close to a small island like a green meadow	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	766
which only rose slightly above the surface of the water	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	766
Our sails were furled	O O O O	sadness	766
and the captain gave permission to all who wished to land for a while and amuse themselves	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	766
I was among the number	O O O O O	sadness	766
but when after strolling about for some time we lighted a fire and sat down to enjoy the repast which we had brought with us	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	766
we were startled by a sudden and violent trembling of the island	O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	766
while at the same moment those left upon the ship set up an outcry bidding us come on board for our lives	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	766
since what we had taken for an island was nothing but the back of a sleeping whale	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	766
Those who were nearest to the boat threw themselves into it	O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	766
others sprang into the sea	O O O O O	sadness	766
but before I could save myself the whale plunged suddenly into the depths of the ocean	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	766
leaving me clinging to a piece of the wood which we had brought to make our fire	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	766
Meanwhile a breeze had sprung up	O O O O O O	sadness	766
and in the confusion that ensued on board our vessel in hoisting the sails and taking up those who were in the boat and clinging to its sides	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	766
no one missed me and I was left at the mercy of the waves	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	766
All that day I floated up and down	O O O O O O O O	sadness	766
now beaten this way	O O O O	sadness	766
now that	O O	sadness	766
and when night fell I despaired for my life	O O O O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	766
but	O	sadness	766
weary and spent as I was	O O O O O O	sadness	766
I clung to my frail support	O O O O O O	sadness	766
and great was my joy when the morning light showed me that I had drifted against an island.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	766
How long I slept I know not	O O O O O O O	sadness	767
but when I opened my eyes and started to my feet I perceived with horror that I was alone and that the ship was gone	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	767
I rushed to and fro like one distracted	O O O O O O O O	sadness	767
uttering cries of despair	O O O B-EMO	sadness	767
and when from the shore I saw the vessel under full sail just disappearing upon the horizon	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	767
I wished bitterly enough that I had been content to stay at home in safety	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	767
But since wishes could do me no good	O O O O O O O O	sadness	767
I presently took courage and looked about me for a means of escape	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	767
When I had climbed a tall tree I first of all directed my anxious glances towards the sea	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	767
but	O	sadness	767
finding nothing hopeful there	O O O O	sadness	767
I turned landward	O O O	sadness	767
and my curiosity was excited by a huge dazzling white object	O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	767
so far off that I could not make out what it might be.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	767
Persecuted by ill-fortune	O O O	sadness	768
and stricken with grief	O O O B-EMO	sadness	768
there seemed to be only one means of safety left to me	O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	768
I shaved my beard and my eyebrows	O O O O O O O	sadness	768
and put on the dress of a calender	O O O O O O O O	sadness	768
in which it was easy for me to travel without being known	O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	768
I avoided the towns till I reached the kingdom of the famous and powerful Caliph	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	768
Haroun-al-Raschid	O	sadness	768
when I had no further reason to fear my enemies	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	768
It was my intention to come to Bagdad and to throw myself at the feet of his Highness	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	768
who would	O O	sadness	768
I felt certain	O O O	sadness	768

One after another the merchants set down a few lines upon the roll	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	771

I came forward	O O O	surprise	771

At first they all thought I was going to throw it into the sea	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	771

I threw myself on the ground and rent my clothes and tore my hair with sorrow	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	773
Then	O	fear	773
fearing to be punished as his murderer by the unhappy father	B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	773
I raised the great stone which blocked the staircase	O O O O O O O O O	fear	773

made everything fast as before.	O O O O O	fear	773
Whilst she was crying the grand-vizir came in and asked if the fish were ready	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	775

The porter looked about him	O O O O O	fear	776
noticing and admiring everything	O O O O	fear	776
but his attention was specially attracted by a third lady sitting on the throne	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	776
who was even more beautiful than the other two	O O O O O O O O O	fear	776
By the respect shown to her by the others	O O O O O O O O O	fear	776
he judged that she must be the eldest	O O O O O O O O	fear	776
and in this he was right	O O O O O O	fear	776
This lady's name was Zobeida	O O O O O	fear	776
the porteress was Sadie	O O O O	fear	776
and the housekeeper was Amina	O O O O O	fear	776
At a word from Zobeida	O O O O O	fear	776
Sadie and Amina took the basket from the porter	O O O O O O O O O	fear	776

paid him handsomely for its use	O O O O O O	fear	776

April 28	O O	surprise	811
- At the office	O O O O	surprise	811
the new and very young clerk Pitt	O O O O O O O	surprise	811
who was very impudent to me a week or so ago	O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	811
was late again	O O O	surprise	811
I told him it would be my duty to inform Mr	O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	811
Perkupp	O	surprise	811
the principal	O O	surprise	811
To my surprise	O O B-EMO	surprise	811
Pitt apologised most humbly and in a most gentlemanly fashion	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	811
I was unfeignedly pleased to notice this improvement in his manner towards me	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	811
and told him I would look over his unpunctuality	O O O O O O O O O	surprise	811
Passing down the room an hour later	O O O O O O O	surprise	811
I received a smart smack in the face from a rolled-up ball of hard foolscap	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	811
I turned round sharply	O O O O	surprise	811
but all the clerks were apparently riveted to their work	O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	811
I am not a rich man	O O O O O O	surprise	811
but I would give half-a-sovereign to know whether that was thrown by accident or design	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	811
Went home early and bought some more enamel paint - black this time - and spent the evening touching up the fender	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	811
picture-frames	O	surprise	811
and an old pair of boots	O O O O O O	surprise	811
making them look as good as new	O O O O O O O	surprise	811
Also painted Gowing's walking-stick	O O O O	surprise	811
which he left behind	O O O O	surprise	811
and made it look like ebony.	O O O O O O	surprise	811
The last time it was the greengrocer's boy	O O O O O O O O	anger	812
who	O	anger	812
not seeing it was me	O O O O O	anger	812
for Sarah had not lighted the gas	O O O O O O O	anger	812
pushed into my hands two cabbages and half-a-dozen coal-blocks	O O O O O O O O O	anger	812
I indignantly threw them on the ground	O O O O O O O	anger	812
and felt so annoyed that I so far forgot myself as to box the boy's ears	O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	812
He went away crying	O O O O	anger	812
and said he should summons me	O O O O O O	anger	812
a thing I would not have happen for the world	O O O O O O O O O O	anger	812
In the dark	O O O	anger	812
I stepped on a piece of the cabbage	O O O O O O O O	anger	812
which brought me down on the flags all of a heap	O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	812
For a moment I was stunned	O O O O O O	anger	812
but when I recovered I crawled upstairs into the drawing-room and on looking into the chimney-glass discovered that my chin was bleeding	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	812
my shirt smeared with the coal-blocks	O O O O O O	anger	812
and my left trouser torn at the knee.	O O O O O O O O	anger	812
July 31	O O	fear	813
- Carrie was very pleased with the bangle	O O O O O O O O	fear	813
which I left with an affectionate note on her dressing-table last night before going to bed	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	813
I told Carrie we should have to start for our holiday next Saturday	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	813
She replied quite happily that she did not mind	O O O O O O O O O	fear	813
except that the weather was so bad	O O O O O O O	fear	813
and she feared that Miss Jibbons would not be able to get her a seaside dress in time	O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	813
I told Carrie that I thought the drab one with pink bows looked quite good enough	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	813
and Carrie said she should not think of wearing it	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	813
I was about to discuss the matter	O O O O O O O	fear	813
when	O	fear	813
remembering the argument yesterday	O O O O	fear	813
resolved to hold my tongue.	O O O O O	fear	813
After Gowing left	O O O	surprise	815
Lupin came in	O O O	surprise	815
and in his anxiety to please Daisy Mutlar	O O O O O O O O	surprise	815
carped at and criticised the arrangements	O O O O O O	surprise	815
and	O	surprise	815
in fact	O O	surprise	815
disapproved of everything	O O O	surprise	815
including our having asked our old friend Cummings	O O O O O O O O	surprise	815
who	O	surprise	815
he said	O O	surprise	815
would look in evening-dress like a green-grocer engaged to wait	O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	815
and who must not be surprised if Daisy took him for one.	O O O O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	815
fter Gowing left	O O O	fear	816
Lupin came in	O O O	fear	816
and in his anxiety to please Daisy Mutlar	O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	816
carped at and criticised the arrangements	O O O O O O	fear	816
and	O	fear	816
in fact	O O	fear	816
disapproved of everything	O O O	fear	816
including our having asked our old friend Cummings	O O O O O O O O	fear	816
who	O	fear	816

and who must not be surprised if Daisy took him for one.	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	816
At ten o'clock we went down to supper	O O O O O O O O	fear	817
and from the way Gowing and Cummings ate you would have thought they had not had a meal for a month	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	817
I told Carrie to keep something back in case Mr	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	817
Perkupp should come by mere chance	O O O O O O	fear	817
Gowing annoyed me very much by filling a large tumbler of champagne	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	817
and drinking it straight off	O O O O O	fear	817
He repeated this action	O O O O	fear	817
and made me fear our half-dozen of champagne would not last out	O O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	817
I tried to keep a bottle back	O O O O O O O	fear	817
but Lupin got hold of it	O O O O O O	fear	817
and took it to the side-table with Daisy and Frank Mutlar.	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	817
When he went	O O O	surprise	818
he said	O O	surprise	818
"to our surprise:  ""I will come to-morrow and bring my Irving make-up"	O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O	surprise	818
Gowing and Cummings said they would like to see it and would come too	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	818
I could not help thinking they might as well give a party at my house while they are about it	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	818
However	O	surprise	818
"as Carrie sensibly said:  ""Do anything"	O O O O O O O	surprise	818
dear	O	surprise	818
"to make Lupin forget the Daisy Mutlar business."""	O O O O O O O O	surprise	818
Lupin	O	surprise	819
to my surprise	O O B-EMO	surprise	819
"said:  ""Oh yes"	O O O O	surprise	819
He showed me the letter before he sent it	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	819
I think he is right	O O O O O	surprise	819
"and you ought to apologise."""	O O O O O	surprise	819
Another thought that strikes me is that Gowing seldom calls in the evening	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	821
and Cummings never does	O O O O	fear	821
I fear they don't get on well with Lupin.	O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	821
January 4	O O	surprise	822
- Mr Perkupp sent for me and told me that my position would be that of one of the senior clerks	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	822
I was more than overjoyed	O O O O B-EMO	surprise	822
Mr Perkupp added	O O O	surprise	822
he would let me know to-morrow what the salary would be	O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	822
This means another day's anxiety	O O O O O	surprise	822
I don't mind	O O O	surprise	822
for it is anxiety of the right sort	O O O O O O O O	surprise	822
That reminded me that I had forgotten to speak to Lupin about the letter I received from Mr Mutlar	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	822
senr	O	surprise	822
I broached the subject to Lupin in the evening	O O O O O O O O O	surprise	822
having first consulted Carrie	O O O O	surprise	822
Lupin was riveted to the FINANCIAL NEWS	O O O O O O O	surprise	822
as if he had been a born capitalist	O O O O O O O O	surprise	822
"and I said:  ""Pardon me a moment"	O O O O O O O O	surprise	822
Lupin	O	surprise	822
how is it you have not been to the Mutlars' any day this week	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	822
After our little supper	O O O O	fear	823
"he said:  ""My dear parents"	O O O O O O	fear	823
I have some news	O O O O	fear	823
which I fear will affect you considerably	O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	823
"""  I felt a qualm come over me"	O O O O O O O O O	fear	823
and said nothing	O O O	fear	823
"Lupin then said:  ""It may distress you - in fact"	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	823
I'm sure it will - but this afternoon I have given up my pony and trap for ever	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	823
It may seem absurd	O O O O	fear	823
but I was so pleased	O O O O O	fear	823
I immediately opened a bottle of port	O O O O O O O	fear	823
Gowing dropped in just in time	O O O O O O	fear	823
bringing with him a large sheet	O O O O O O	fear	823
with a print of a tailless donkey	O O O O O O O	fear	823
which he fastened against the wall	O O O O O O	fear	823
He then produced several separate tails	O O O O O O	fear	823
and we spent the remainder of the evening trying blindfolded to pin a tail on in the proper place	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	823
My sides positively ached with laughter when I went to bed.	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	823
In the evening Lupin arrived home early	O O O O O O O	surprise	824
and seemed a little agitated	O O O O O	surprise	824
"I said:  ""What's up"	O O O O O	surprise	824
my boy	O O	surprise	824
"""  He hesitated a good deal"	O O O O O O O	surprise	824

"I replied:  ""Yes"	O O O O	surprise	824

His bank was the Third National of Philadelphia	O O O O O O O O	fear	825
located in that center of all Philadelphia and indeed	O O O O O O O O O	fear	825
at that time	O O O	fear	825
of practically all national finance--Third Street--and its owners conducted a brokerage business as a side line	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	825
There was a perfect plague of State banks	O O O O O O O O	fear	825
great and small	O O O	fear	825
in those days	O O O	fear	825
issuing notes practically without regulation upon insecure and unknown assets and failing and suspending with astonishing rapidity	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	825
and a knowledge of all these was an important requirement of Mr Cowperwood's position	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	825
As a result	O O O	fear	825
he had become the soul of caution	O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO	fear	825
Unfortunately	O	fear	825
for him	O O	fear	825
he lacked in a great measure the two things that are necessary for distinction in any field--magnetism and vision	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	825
He was not destined to be a great financier	O O O O O O O O O	fear	825
though he was marked out to be a moderately successful one	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	825
About a year later	O O O O	sadness	830
Mr Semple died	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	830
It was an untimely death	O O O O O	sadness	830
one of those fortuitous and in a way insignificant episodes which are	O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	830
nevertheless	O	sadness	830
dramatic in a dull way to those most concerned	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	830
He was seized with a cold in the chest late in the fall--one of those seizures ordinarily attributed to wet feet or to going out on a damp day without an overcoat--and had insisted on going to business when Mrs	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	830
Semple urged him to stay at home and recuperate	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	830
He was in his way a very determined person	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	830
not obstreperously so	O O O	sadness	830
but quietly and under the surface	O O O O O O	sadness	830
Business was a great urge	O O O O O	sadness	830
He saw himself soon to be worth about fifty thousand dollars	O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	830
Then this cold--nine more days of pneumonia--and he was dead	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	830
The shoe store was closed for a few days	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	830
the house was full of sympathetic friends and church people	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	830
There was a funeral	O O O O	sadness	830
with burial service in the Callowhill Presbyterian Church	O O O O O O O O	sadness	830
to which they belonged	O O O O	sadness	830
and then he was buried	O O O O O	sadness	830
Mrs	O	sadness	830
Semple cried bitterly	O O O	sadness	830
The shock of death affected her greatly and left her for a time in a depressed state	O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	830
A brother of hers	O O O O	sadness	830
David Wiggin	O O	sadness	830
undertook for the time being to run the shoe business for her	O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	830
There was no will	O O O O	sadness	830
but in the final adjustment	O O O O O	sadness	830
which included the sale of the shoe business	O O O O O O O O	sadness	830
there being no desire on anybody's part to contest her right to all the property	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	830
she received over eighteen thousand dollars	O O O O O O	sadness	830
She continued to reside in the Front Street house	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	830
and was considered a charming and interesting widow.	O O O O O O O O	sadness	830
Meanwhile he called on Mrs	O O O O O	happiness	832
Semple	O	happiness	832
and the more he called the better he liked her	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	832
There was no exchange of brilliant ideas between them	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	832
but he had a way of being comforting and social when he wished	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	832
He advised her about her business affairs in so intelligent a way that even her relatives approved of it	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	832
She came to like him	O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O	happiness	832
because he was so considerate	O O O O O	happiness	832
quiet	O	happiness	832
reassuring	O	happiness	832
and so ready to explain over and over until everything was quite plain to her	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	832
She could see that he was looking on her affairs quite as if they were his own	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	832
trying to make them safe and secure.	O O O O O O O	happiness	832
It was while he was calling on her in this way that his Uncle Seneca died in Cuba and left him fifteen thousand dollars	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	833
This money made him worth nearly twenty-five thousand dollars in his own right	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	833
and he knew exactly what to do with it	O O O O O O O O O	fear	833
A panic had come since Mr Semple had died	O B-EMO O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	833
which had illustrated to him very clearly what an uncertain thing the brokerage business was	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	833
There was really a severe business depression.	O O O O O O O	fear	833
Next day I joined Grant once more	O O O O O O O	fear	834
and found he had collected a few Sorombo men	O O O O O O O O O	fear	834
hoping to follow after me	O O O O O	fear	834
I then told him all my mishaps in Sorombo	O O O O O O O O O	fear	834
"as well as of the ""blue-devil"" frights that had seized all my men"	O O O O O O B-EMO O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	834
I felt greatly alarmed about the prospects of the expedition	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	834
scarcely knowing what I should do	O O O O O O	fear	834
I resolved at last	O O O O	fear	834
if everything else failed	O O O O	fear	834
to make up a raft at the southern end of the N'yanza	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	834
and try to go up to the Nile in that way.	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	834
These separations from Grant were most annoying	O O O O O O O	fear	835
but they could not be helped	O O O O O O	fear	835
so	O	fear	835
when all was settled here	O O O O O	fear	835
I bade him adieu-- both of us saying we would do our best--and set out on my journey	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	835
thinking what a terrible thing it was I could not prevail on my men to view things as I did	O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	835
Neither my experience with native chiefs	O O O O O O	fear	835
nor my money and guns	O O O O O	fear	835
were of any use to me	O O O O O O	fear	835
simply because my men were such incomprehensible fools	O O O O O O O O	fear	835
though many of them who had travelled before ought to have known better.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	835
When within a few miles of the palace we were ordered to stop and wait for Kachuchu's return	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	836
but no sooner put up in a plaintain grove	O O O O O O O O O	fear	836
where pombe was brewing	O O O O	fear	836
and our men were all taking a suck at it	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	836
than the worthy arrived to call us on the same instant	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	836
as the king was most anxious to see us	O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU	fear	836
The love of good beer of course made our men all too tired to march again	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	836
More reports came to us about Suwarora	O O O O O O O	sadness	837
all of the most inviting nature	O O O O O O	sadness	837
but nothing else worth mentioning occurred until we reached the border of Msalala	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	837
where an officer of M'yonga's	O O O O O	sadness	837
who said he was a bigger man than his chief	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	837
demanded a tax	O O O	sadness	837
which I refused	O O O	sadness	837
and the dispute ended in his snatching Nasib's gun out of his hands	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	837
I thought little of this affair myself	O O O O O O O	sadness	837
beyond regretting the delay which it might occasion	O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	837
as M'yonga	O O	sadness	837
I knew	O O	sadness	837
would not permit such usage	O O O O O	sadness	837
if I chose to go round by his palace and make a complaint	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	837
Both Bui and Nasib	O O O O	sadness	837
however	O	sadness	837
were so greatly alarmed	O O O O	sadness	837
that before I could say a word they got the gun back again by paying four yards merikani.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	837
Lumeresi	O	disgust	838
on hearing this	O O O	disgust	838
first consulted me	O O O	disgust	838
saying his chief was displeased with him	O O O O B-EMO O O	disgust	838
accusing him of being too proud	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	838
in having at once two such distinguished guests	O O O O O O O O	disgust	838
and meant by these acts only to humble him	O O O O O O O O O	disgust	838
I replied	O O	disgust	838
if that was the case	O O O O O	disgust	838
the sooner he allowed us to go	O O O O O O O	disgust	838
the better it would be for him	O O O O O O O	disgust	838
and	O	disgust	838
reminding him of his original promise to give me assistance on to Usui	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	838
said he could do so now with a very good grace.	O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	838
His badges of office he had tied on his head	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	839
the butt of a shell	O O O O O	happiness	839
representing the officer's badge	O O O O	happiness	839
being fixed on the forehead	O O O O O	happiness	839
whilst a small sheep's horn	O O O O O	happiness	839
fixed jauntily over the temple	O O O O O	happiness	839
denoted that he was a magician	O O O O O O	happiness	839
Wishing to try my powers in magical arts	O O O O O O O O	happiness	839
as I laughed at his church	O O O O O O	happiness	839
he begged me to produce an everlasting spring of water by simply scratching the ground	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	839
however	O	happiness	839
drew short up	O O O	happiness	839
to the intense delight of my men	O O O B-EMO O O O	happiness	839
on my promising that I would do so if he made one first.	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	839
This night one was shot	O O O O O	happiness	840
without any mistake about it	O O O O O	happiness	840
for the next morning we tracked him by his blood	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	840
and afterwards heard he had died of his wound	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	840
The Wasui elders	O O O	happiness	840
contrary to my expectation	O O O O	happiness	840
then came and congratulated us on our success	O O O O O O O O	happiness	840
They thought us most wonderful men	O O O O B-EMO O	happiness	840
and possessed of supernatural powers	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	840
for the thief in question was a magician	O O O O O O O O	happiness	840
who until now was thought to be invulnerable	O O O O O O O O	happiness	840
Indeed	O	happiness	840
they said Arabs with enormous caravans had often been plundered by these people	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	840
but though they had so many more guns than ourselves	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	840
they never succeeded in killing one.	O O O O O O	happiness	840
Nasib then returned to inform us that the king had heard our complaint	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	841
and was sorry for it	O O B-EMO O O	sadness	841
but said he could not interfere with the rights of his officers	O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	841
He did not wish himself to take anything from us	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	841
and hoped we would come on to him as soon as we had satisfied his officers with the trifle they wanted	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	841
Virembo then sent us some pombe by his officers	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	841
and begged us to have patience	O O O O O O	sadness	841
for he was then fleecing Masudi at the encamping-ground near the palace.	O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	841
Early in the morning we were on foot again	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	842
only too thankful to have got off so cheaply	O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	842
Then men were appointed as guides and protectors	O O O O O O O O	happiness	842
to look after us as far as the border	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	842
What an honour	O O O	happiness	842
We had come into the country drawn there by a combination of pride and avarice and now we were leaving it in hot haste under the guidance of an escort of officers	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	842
who were in reality appointed to watch us as dangerous wizards and objects of terror.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	842
Whilst Baraka's arguments all rested the other way	O O O O O O O O	disgust	843
-- that no one could tell what was ahead of him--Bana had sold himself to luck and the devil--but though he did not care for his own safety	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	843
he ought not to sacrifice the lives of others--Bombay and his lot were fools for their pains in trusting to him.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	843
At his invitation we now crossed over the spur to the Ingezi Kagera side	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	844
when	O	surprise	844
to surprise me	O B-EMO O	surprise	844
the canoes I had come up the lake in appeared before us	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	844
They had gone out of the lake at its northern end	O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	844
paddled into	O O	surprise	844
and then up the Kagera to where we stood	O O O O O O O O O	surprise	844
showing	O	surprise	844
by actual navigation	O O O	surprise	844
the connection of these highland lakes with the rivers which drain the various spurs of the Mountains of the Moon.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	844
A man from Ruanda then told us of the Wilyanwantu (men-eaters)	O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	845
who disdained all food but human flesh	O O O O O O O	disgust	845
and Rumanika confirmed the statement	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	845
Though I felt very sceptical about it	O O O O B-EMO O O	disgust	845
I could not help thinking it a curious coincidence that the position they were said to occupy agreed with Petherick's Nyam Nyams (men-eaters).	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	845
We then went into a discourse on astrology	O O O O O O O O	disgust	846
when the intelligent Rumanika asked me if the same sun we saw one day appeared again	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	846
or whether fresh suns came every day	O O O O O O O	disgust	846
and whether or not the moon made different faces	O O O O O O O O O	disgust	846
to laugh at us mortals on earth.	O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	846
Next day	O O	happiness	847
after crossing more of those abominable rush-drains	O O O O O O O	happiness	847
whilst in sight of the Victoria N'yanza	O O O O O O O	happiness	847
we ascended the most beautiful hills	O O O O B-EMO O	happiness	847
covered with verdure of all descriptions	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	847
At Meruka	O O	happiness	847
where I put up	O O O O	happiness	847
there resided some grandees	O O O O	happiness	847
the chief of whom was the king's aunt	O O O O O O O O	happiness	847
She sent me a goat	O O O O O	happiness	847
a hen	O O	happiness	847
a basket of eggs	O O O O	happiness	847
and some plantains	O O O	happiness	847
in return for which I sent her a wire and some beads.	O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	847
No one knew of a lake to supply the waters	O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	848
nor where they came from	O O O O O	surprise	848
That they flowed into the lake there was no doubt--as I could see by the trickling waters in some few places--and they lay exactly on the equator	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	848
Rising out of the valley	O O O O O	surprise	848
I found all the country just as hilly as before	O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	848
but many of the rush-drains going to northward	O O O O O O O O	surprise	848
and in the dells were such magnificent trees	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	848
they quite took me by surprise	O O O O O B-EMO	surprise	848
Clean-trunked	O	surprise	848
they towered up just as so many great pillars	O O O O O O O O O	surprise	848
and then spread out their high branches like a canopy over us	O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	848
I thought of the blue gums of Australia	O O O O O O O O	surprise	848
and believed these would beat them.	O O O O O O	surprise	848
I then (16th) very much wished to go and see the escape of the Mwerango river	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	849
as I still felt a little sceptical as to its origin	O O O O O O B-EMO O O O O	disgust	849
whether or not it came off those smaller lakes I had seen on the road the day before I crossed the river	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	849
but no one would listen to my project	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	849
They all said I must have the king's sanction first	O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	849
else people	O O	disgust	849
from not knowing my object	O O O O O	disgust	849
would accuse me of practising witchcraft	O O O O O O	disgust	849
and would tell their king so	O O O O O O	disgust	849
They still all maintained that the river did come out of the lake	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	849
and said	O O	disgust	849
if I liked to ask the king's leave to visit the spot	O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	849
then they would go and show it me.	O O O O O O O O	disgust	849
The day was now gone	O O O O O	fear	850
so torches were lit	O O O O	fear	850
and we were ordered to go	O O O O O O	fear	850
though as yet I had not been able to speak one word I wished to impart about Petherick and Grant	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	850
for my interpreters were so afraid of the king they dared not open their mouths until they were spoken to	O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	850
The king was now rising to go	O O O O O O O	fear	850
when	O	fear	850
in great fear and anxiety that the day would be lost	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	850
I said	O O	fear	850
in Kisuahili	O O	fear	850
"""I wish you would send a letter by post to Grant"	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	850
and also send a boat up the Kitangule	O O O O O O O O	fear	850
as far as Rumanika's palace	O O O O O	fear	850
for him	O O	fear	850
"for he is totally unable to walk."""	O O O O O O O	fear	850
The pages dreaded their master's wrath	O O O O O O	sadness	851
departed for a while	O O O O	sadness	851
and then sent another lad to tell me he was sorry to hear I felt unwell	O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	851
but he hoped I would come if only for a minute	O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	851
bringing my medicines with me	O O O O O	sadness	851
for he himself felt pain	O O O O O	sadness	851
That this second message was a forged one I had no doubt	O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	851
for the boys had not been long enough gone	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	851
still	O	sadness	851
I packed up my medicines and went	O O O O O O O	sadness	851
leaving the onus	O O O	sadness	851
should any accident happen	O O O O	sadness	851
upon the mischievous story- bearers.	O O O O O	sadness	851
I then sent Bombay to see the queen	O O O O O O O O	fear	852
to ask after her health	O O O O O	fear	852
beg for a hut in the palace enclosures	O O O O O O O O	fear	852
and say I should have gone myself	O O O O O O O	fear	852
only I feared her gate might be shut	O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	852
and I cannot go backwards and forwards so far in the sun without a horse or an elephant to ride upon	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	852
She begged I would come next morning.	O O O O O O O	fear	852
5th	O	sadness	853
Alarmed at having got involved in something that looked like court intrigues	O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	853
I called up N'yamgundu	O O O O	sadness	853
told him all that happened yesterday	O O O O O O	sadness	853
both at the two courts and with Maula at home	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	853
and begged him to apply to the king for a meeting of five elders	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	853
that a proper understanding might be arrived at	O O O O O O O O	sadness	853
but instead of doing as I desired	O O O O O O O	sadness	853
he got into a terrible fright	O O O O B-EMO O	sadness	853
calling Maula	O O	sadness	853
and told me if I pressed the matter in this way men would lose their lives	O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	853
Meanwhile the cunning blackguard Maula begged for pardon	O O O O O O O O	sadness	853
said I quite misunderstood his meaning	O O O O O O	sadness	853
all he had said was that I was very fortunate	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	853
being in such favour at court	O O O O O O	sadness	853
for the king and queen both equally loved me.	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	853
These Wakungu	O O	sadness	854
having only just then returned from plundering Unyoro	O O O O O O O O	sadness	854
had never before seen their king in a chair	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	854
or anybody sitting	O O O	sadness	854
as I was	O O O	sadness	854
by his side	O O O	sadness	854
and it being foreign to their notions	O O O O O O O	sadness	854
as well as	O O O	sadness	854
perhaps	O	sadness	854
unpleasant to their feelings	O O O O	sadness	854
to find a stranger sitting higher than themselves	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	854
they complained against this outrage to custom	O B-EMO O O O O O	sadness	854
and induced the king to order my dethronement	O O O O O O O O	sadness	854
The result was	O O O	sadness	854
as my iron stool was objectionable	O O O O O O	sadness	854
I stood for a moment to see that I thoroughly understood their meaning	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	854
and then showing them my back	O O O O O O	sadness	854
walked straightway home to make a grass throne	O O O O O O O O	sadness	854
and dodge them that way.	O O O O O	sadness	854
This double failure was a more serious affair then a mere slight	O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	855
for my cows were eaten up	O O O O O O	sadness	855
and my men clamouring incessantly for food	O O O O O O O	sadness	855
"and though they might by orders help themselves ""ku n'yangania""--by seizing--from the Waganda"	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O	sadness	855
it hurt my feelings so much to witness this	O B-EMO O O O O O O O	sadness	855
that I tried from the first to dispense with it	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	855
telling the king I had always flogged my men for stealing	O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	855
and now he turned them into a pack of thieves.	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	855
Fortunat made no reply	O O O O	sadness	856
de Valorsay's gayety	O O O	sadness	856
instead of cheering	O O O	sadness	856
saddened him	B-EMO O	sadness	856
"""Ah"	O	sadness	856

"and will dim them in weeping for her vanished millions."""	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	856
Possibly it was because she did not know where Pascal was going	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	858
Possibly M de Coralth was the cause of herstrange disquietude	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O B-EMO	fear	858
for she utterly disliked the viscount	O O O O O O	fear	858
Her woman's instinct warned her that there was something unwholesome about this young man's peculiar handsomeness	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	858

What could it all mean	O O O O O	fear	859
What sorrowful recollections	O O O	fear	859
what mysterious apprehensions	O O O	fear	859
had my words aroused in the count's mind	O O O O O O O O	fear	859
I could not understand or imagine why he should regard my question as strange or unnatural	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	859
On the contrary	O O O	fear	859
I thought it perfectly natural	O O O O O	fear	859
dictated as it had been by circumstances	O O O O O O O	fear	859
and by the count's own words and manner.	O O O O O O O O	fear	859
Fortunat left the restaurant	O O O O	fear	860
almost on the run	O O O O	fear	860
for he feared that he might be pursued and overtaken by M Casimir	O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	860
But after he had gone a couple of hundred paces	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	860
he paused	O O	fear	860
not so much to take breath	O O O O O O	fear	860
as to collect his scattered wits	O O O O O O	fear	860
and though the weather was cold	O O O O O O	fear	860
he seated himself on a bench to reflect.	O O O O O O O O	fear	860
He would later bristle whenever anyone referred to Paul and Clara Jobs as his adoptive parents or implied that they were not his real parents.	O O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	864

He was rather pathetic	O O O O	sadness	873
having drunk nothing out of respect to the occasion	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	873
he felt	O O	sadness	873
somewhere deep down in him	O O O O O	sadness	873
a persistent exaltation that his brother Charles was dead	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	873
but he knew that it was not decent to allow this feeling to conquer him and he was truly anxious to protect and comfort his niece so well as he was able	O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O B-EMO O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	873

It was the Polchester View that she chose to-day	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	874

There was no one to help her	O O O O O O O	surprise	885
She was alone	O O O	surprise	885

But there was something in her aunt that prevented complete confidence.	O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	889
Brother and sister shook hands	O O O O O	surprise	891
and Maggie	O O	surprise	891
as she watched them	O O O O	surprise	891
was surprised to feel within herself a certain sympathy with her uncle	O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	891
Aunt Anne's greeting was gentle and kind but infinitely distant	O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	891
and had something of the tenderness with which the Pope washes the feet of the beggars in Rome.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	891
Her uncle looked at her with great surprise	O O O O O O O B-EMO	surprise	892
after his behaviour of last night he had not expected this	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	892

rubbing his hands together and turning one boot against the other.	O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	892

"""After all"	O O	fear	893

She remembered the feeling and passion with which her aunt had repeated the Twenty-third Psalm	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	893
She was puzzled.	O O O	fear	893
In part because she had always been so reserved a child	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	894
in part because there had been no one in whom she might confide even had she wished it	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	894
she had always placed an intensity of feeling around and about the few things that were hers	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	894
Her library was very small	O O O O O	happiness	894
but this did not distress her because she had never cared for reading	O O O B-EMO I-EMO O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	894
Upon the little hanging shelf above her bed (deal wood painted white	O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	894
with blue cornflowers) were The Heir of Redclyffe	O O O O O O O O	happiness	894

Thus her aunt found her	O O O O O	happiness	895
later in the evening	O O O O	happiness	895
She was touched by the figure	O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU	happiness	895
the shabby black frock	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	895
the white tired face	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	895
She had been honestly disappointed in her niece	O O O O O O O O	happiness	895
disappointed in her plainness	O O O O	happiness	895
in her apparent want of heart	O O O O O O	happiness	895
in her silence and moroseness.	O O O O O	happiness	895
The rest of the interview came to her only dimly	O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	898
She knew that Uncle Mathew was still upon his feet protesting	O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	898
that her aunt's face was cold and wore a look of distressed surprise as though some one had suddenly been rude to her.	O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	898
She chose instinctively her path	O O O O O	surprise	900
through the kitchen garden at the back of the village	O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	900
down the hill by the village street	O O O O O O O	surprise	900
over the little bridge that crossed the rocky stream of the Dreot	O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	900
and up the steep hill that led on to the outskirts of Rothin Moor	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	900
The day	O O	surprise	900
although she had no eyes for it	O O O O O O O	surprise	900
was one of those sudden impulses of misty warmth that surprise the Glebeshire frosts	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O B-EMO O O O	surprise	900
The long stretch of the moor was enwrapped by a thin silver network of haze	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	900
the warmth of the sun	O O O O O	surprise	900
seen so dimly that it was like a shadow reflected in a mirror	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	900
struck to the very heart of the soil.	O O O O O O O O	surprise	900
Her first thought as she went forward was disgust at her own weakness	O O O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	901
once again she had been betrayed by her feelings	O O O O O O O O O	fear	901
She could remember no single time when they had not betrayed her.	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	901
When at last she found herself	O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	902
a tiny figure	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	902
standing upon the vast platform under the high black dome	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	902
the noise and confusion excited and delighted her	O O O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O	happiness	902
She rose to the waves of sound as a swimmer rises in the sea	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	902
her heart beat fast	O O O O	happiness	902
and she was so eagerly engaged in looking about her	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	902
in staring at the hurrying people	O O O O O O	happiness	902
in locating the shrill screams of the engines	O O O O O O O O	happiness	902
"""Oh"	O	sadness	904

She glared about her and felt as though she had been taken prisoner by some strange people who lived under the sea.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	907
Maggie fancied that the three persons were nervous of her aunt	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	909
the stout young man was amused perhaps at the general situation	O O O O O B-EMO O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	909
but Mr	O O	happiness	909

the colour mounting into his high bony cheeks and his nostrils twitching like a horse's.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	909
There was no one in the room	O O O O O O O	fear	910
she felt	O O	fear	910
as she lay there	O O O O	fear	910
an increasing irritation at her weakness	O O O O O O	fear	910

Did she faint like this at the earliest opportunity people would allow her no chance of earning her living.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	910
She stared at her aunt	O O O O O	happiness	911
then at a long mirror that faced her bed	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	911
then at the lighted sky	O O O O O	happiness	911
She felt warmly grateful	O O B-EMO I-EMO	happiness	911

She laughed at herself in the glass	O O O O O O O	happiness	912
She was happy	O O B-EMO	happiness	912

Aunt Anne walked first and took what was obviously her own regular seat near the front	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	917

How fantastic these theories of fire and passion must seem	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	925
he amused himself by considering	O B-EMO O O B-CAU	happiness	925
to any one who knew his mother only from the outside.	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	925
Her fear was of Martin	O O O O O	fear	927
She feared very deeply his influence upon her husband	O B-EMO O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU	fear	927
During Martin's absence she and Amy had managed very successfully to have the house as they wished it	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	927
John Warlock	O O	fear	927
the master	O O	fear	927
had been too deeply occupied with the affairs of the soul to be concerned also with the affairs of the body.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	927
Such things could not frighten	O O O O O	fear	929
of course--he was no longer a child--and yet because he had once been frightened some impression of alarm and dismay hovered over him.	O O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O B-EMO O O O	fear	929

What did Martin remember	O O O O	surprise	932
He remembered a good deal	O O O O O	surprise	932
He was surprised when he began to think	O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	932
"""Did he remember"	O O O	surprise	932
his father suggested a scene	O O O O O	surprise	932

His father continued	O O O	surprise	932
as though it had been for his own pleasure.	O O O O O O O O O	surprise	932
He could see Mason Street with its grocer's shop at the corner	O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	933
its Baths and Public Library	O O O O O	happiness	933
the sudden little black dips into the areas as the houses followed one another	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	933
the lamp-post opposite their window that had always excited him because it leaned inwards a little as though it would presently tumble	O O O O O O O O B-EMO O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O	happiness	933
He remembered the fat short cook with the pink cotton dress who wheezed and blew so when she had to climb the stairs.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	933
Then when at last she had mounted the vehicle she would flood the conductor with a stream of little questions	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	936
darting her eyes angrily at all her neighbours as though they were gathered there together to murder her at the earliest opportunity	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	936
She would be desperately confused when asked to pay for her ticket	O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	936
would be unable to find her purse	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	936

In such an agony would she be at the threatened passing of her destination that she would spring up at every pause of the omnibus	O O O B-EMO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	936
striking her nearest neighbour's eye or nose with her umbrella	O O O O O O O O O O	anger	936
apologising nervously	O O	anger	936
and then	O O	anger	936
because she thought she had been too forward with a stranger	O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	936
staring fiercely about her and daring any one to speak to her.	O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	936
Her attitude was one of surprised excitement	O O O O O O O	surprise	937
She was amazed by the most ordinary incidents and conversations	O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	937
She found Maggie's life quite incredible.	O O O O O O	surprise	937
She had been trained in another school from Caroline	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	938
she felt from the very first that upon certain questions her lovely friend was inexperienced	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	938
foolish and dangerously reckless	O O O O	sadness	938
"On the question of ""men"	O O O O O	sadness	938
""" for instance"	O O O	sadness	938
Maggie	O	sadness	938
with clear knowledge of her father and her uncle	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	938
refused to follow Caroline's light and easy excursions	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	938
Caroline was disappointed	O O B-EMO	sadness	938
she had a great deal to say on the subject and could speak	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	938
she assured Maggie	O O O	sadness	938
"from a vast variety of experience: ""Men are all the same."	O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	938
Maggie soon discovered that Mr	O O O O O	happiness	939

His attitude seemed to be that the atmosphere that she left behind her was enough for him and that he could not	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	939
in justice	O O	happiness	939
expect any more.	O O O	happiness	939
I realised that by nine out of every ten men and five out of every ten women the literary page in the paper is turned over with exactly the same impatience with which I turn over the betting columns	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	941
Anyway	O	sadness	941
why not	O O	sadness	941
perfectly right	O O	sadness	941
And then by this time I'd seen my old books	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	941
often enough	O O	sadness	941
lying scattered amongst dusty piles in second- hand shops marked	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	941
'All this lot 6d.'	O O O O	sadness	941
The young man was apparently in love with a lady much older than himself	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	942
who wore pince-nez	O O O	surprise	942
but it was an arid kind of love in which the young man discovered motives and symptoms with the same dexterous surprise with which he discovered newts and tadpoles in the cellar-pond	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	942
Maggie bravely attacked Mr	O O O O	surprise	942

This was beyond Maggie altogether	O O O O O	happiness	944
An agreeable thing	O B-EMO O	happiness	944
however	O	happiness	944
about Mr	O O	happiness	944
Magnus was that he did not mind when you disliked his work	O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	944
He seemed to expect that you would not like it	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	944
He was certainly a very unconceited man.	O O O O O O O	happiness	944
I couldn't imagine what they were all about	O O O O O O O O	happiness	945
it wasn't the ordinary London congregation	O O O O O O	happiness	945
it was almost the ordinary London service and yet not quite	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	945
there was an air of expectation and even excitement which is most unusual in a London church	O O O O O O O O B-EMO O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	945
Then there was Warlock	O O O O	happiness	945
Of course one could see at once that he was an extraordinary man	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	945
a kind of prophet all on his own	O O O O O O O O	happiness	945
Oh yes	O O	sadness	946
one of them went back	O O O O O	sadness	946
I remember	O O	sadness	946
But his actual meeting with his girl was so disappointing in comparison with his long expectation of it in front of the Temple that he took the next boat back to the island	O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	946

He travelled everywhere and died	O O O O O	sadness	946
a disappointed man	O O O	sadness	946
"at sea."""	O O	sadness	946
What was there then in Maggie that started up in rebellion at this unexpected declaration	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	947
She had been sitting there	O O O O O	happiness	947
tranquil	O	happiness	947
soothed with a happy sense that her new life was developing securely for her in the way that she would have it	O O O B-EMO O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	947
Suddenly she was alert	O O O O	happiness	947

"""Said"	O	fear	948

Then as her mind returned back to her uncle she felt with a throb of excited anticipation that perhaps after all this evening was to prove the turning-point of her life	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	952

on his side	O O O	surprise	954
as he looked down at her	O O O O O O	surprise	954
was surprised at his own excitement	O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	954

simply because she was utterly unlike any one else	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	955

"but ""he would be bothered if she was simple in anything else"	O O O B-EMO I-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	956
She had made up her mind--he knew it as well as though she had told him--to trust him absolutely	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	956
and he knew well enough how little he was to be trusted.	O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	956
Amy hated him	O O O	fear	957
his mother hid herself from him	O O O O O O	fear	957
and his father's love frightened him	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU B-EMO O	fear	957
Already he had found himself telling lies to avoid the chapel services and the meetings with Thurston and the rest.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	957

suddenly feeling that that glance had not the things in it that she had wanted	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	966

her confidence left her	O O O O	fear	966
she felt that if she did not have a word alone with him she would die.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	966

waiting	O	sadness	968
so that he might have a word with her before they went in	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	968

She saw no one whom she knew	O O O O O O O	sadness	968

There seemed to be more of the servant class	O O O O O O O O O	fear	969

without a word	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	969
not moving	B-CAU I-CAU	fear	969

Maggie was frightened	O O B-EMO	fear	969

there was	O O	happiness	970

a polite little struggle between Miss Avies and Aunt Anne as to who should have the corner with a wooden arm upon which to rest.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	970

a blazing furnace	O O O	fear	975

She wanted to run away from the house	O O O O O O O O	sadness	976
miles and miles and miles	O O O O O	sadness	976
She climbed into bed and thought of her escape	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	976

sometimes her sentences were confused and unfinished	O B-CAU I-CAU O B-EMO O O	sadness	978
sometimes they seemed to Maggie to have no meaning	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	978
once or twice the voice dropped so low that Maggie did not catch the words	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	978
but always there was especial urgency behind the carelessness as though every word were being spoken for a listener's benefit--a listener who sat perhaps with pencil and notebook somewhere in the dark behind them.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	978

He had great ideas about taste	O O O O O O	happiness	1030
some of his secret fears had been lest her strange uncouth upbringing should have caused her to like gaudy things.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1030

Maggie was ashamed of her stubby finger as she put her hand forward--but the ring fitted exactly.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1031
They were both so fat and he had his coat and waistcoat off and he was kissing her neck	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1033
My word	O O	fear	1033
they were frightened when they saw me standing there	O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1033
After that I could do what I liked with the cook	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1033
We used to have prayer meetings in the drawing-room	O O O O O O O O O	fear	1033
and sometimes father would pray so hard that the glass chandelier would shake and rattle till I used to think it would come down.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1033
I always knew I could turn them round my little finger	O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1034
I always knew he'd rather do anything than make me unhappy	O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O B-EMO	sadness	1034
Sometimes we had lovely times together	O O O O O O	sadness	1034
sitting in the dusk in the front of the fire.	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1034
It was a terrific excitement for her	O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O O	happiness	1035
apart altogether from her love for Martin	O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1035
She had	O O	happiness	1035
of course	O O	happiness	1035
never been to a theatre	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1035
She could not imagine in the least what it was like.	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1035
They started off towards Shaftesbury Avenue where the theatre was	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1037
and as they went a funny little incident occurred	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1037
They were both too happy to talk and Maggie was too happy even to think	O O O O B-EMO O O O O O O O O O B-CAU	happiness	1037
Suddenly she was aware that some one was coming towards her whom she knew	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1037
She looked and tugged herself from that world of Martin and only Martin in which she was immersed.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1037
Martin moved on a little and stood waiting for her	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1038
She was confused and embarrassed but pleased too because he seemed glad to see her	O O B-EMO O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1038

Stupid the pleasure that his few words had given her	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1042
but she felt once again	O O O O O	happiness	1042
as she had felt in Katherine Mark's drawing-room	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1042
the contact with that other world	O O O O O O	happiness	1042
that safe	O O	happiness	1042

assured world in which everything was exactly what it seemed	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1042

Then she could not be so wild and odd and uncivilised as she often was afraid that she was.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1042
As he breathed she breathed too	O O O O O O	sadness	1044
and it seemed to her that their bodies rose and fell as one body	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1044
Without looking directly at him	O O O O O	sadness	1044
which would	O O	sadness	1044
she knew	O O	sadness	1044
embarrass him before all those hungry people behind her	B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1044
she could out of the corner of her eye see the ruddy brown of his cheek and the hard thick curve of his shoulder.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1044
But meanwhile	O O	sadness	1046
of course	O O	sadness	1046
she saw a handsome young soldier who was young like herself	O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1046
and she was naturally bored with the studious gentleman	O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1046
Maggie shared all the feelings of the Charity girl	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1046
Had she been brought up	O O O O O	sadness	1046
say by a man like Mr	O O O O O O	sadness	1046

why	O	sadness	1046
of course	O O	sadness	1046
she could have gone only one way.	O O O O O O O	sadness	1046
Tea came	O O	happiness	1047
but she could not eat anythingIn some strange way that moment in the theatre when he had pressed her hand had altered everythingShe recognised in herself a new Maggie	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1047
she was excited with a thick burning excitement	O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1047
she was almost sleepy with the strain of it and her cheeks were hot	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1047
but her throat icy coldWhen she told him that she wasn't hungry	O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1047
he said	O O	happiness	1047
"""I'm not either"	O O O	happiness	1047

not looking at her	O O O O	happiness	1047
"""That fellow won't be back for an hour."""	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1047

this loneliness	O O	happiness	1048

beside him	B-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1048
she would fear nothing	O O B-EMO I-EMO	happiness	1048
That night	O O	happiness	1048
the first faint suspicion of jealousy	O O O O O O	happiness	1048
of doubt	O O	happiness	1048
an agonising dart of pain at the knowledge of what it would mean to her now if he left her	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1048
stirred in her breastThis room was stifling	O O O O O O O	happiness	1048
Aunt Anne's aloofness was coloured now with a very human anger	O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1049
Maggie realised with surprise that she had never seen her angry before	O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1049

The mist of anger dimmed the room	O O O O O O O	fear	1050
it was in the potatoes and the cold dry mutton	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1050
especially was it in the hard pallid knobs of cheese	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1050
And Aunt Elizabeth	O O O	fear	1050
although she was frightened by her sister's anger on this occasion	O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1050
shared in it	O O O	fear	1050
She pursed her lips at Maggie and moved her fat	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1050
podgy hand as though she would like to smack Maggie's cheeks.	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1050
She went up to her bedroom	O O O O O O	fear	1054
and when she reached it she realised	O O O O O O O	fear	1054
with a little pang of fright	B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO	fear	1054
that she was a prisoner	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1054

there WAS something behind it all--something for which they had a right to be searching	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1066
even of that she had not sure knowledge-- but the pathos and also the bravery of their search touched and moved her	O O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O	happiness	1066
She was beginning to understand something of the beauty that hovered like a bird always just out of sight about the ugly walls of the Chapel.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1066
Only Martin was flesh and blood	O O O O O O	fear	1067

the strange mixture of superstition and self-reproach and self-distrust that overwhelmed him when she was not with him.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1068

It may well be believed that the prince felt in despair at this fresh misfortune	O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1122
which obliged him to spend another year in a strange and distasteful country	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1122

he had once more lost the Princess Badoura's talisman	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1122

and to live on in the cottage	O O O O O O O	sadness	1122
As he could not well cultivate the garden by himself	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1122
he engaged a lad to help him	O O O O O O O	sadness	1122
and to secure the rest of the treasure he put the remaining gold dust into fifty more jars	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1122
filling them up with olives so as to have them ready for transport.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1122

His mother	O O	fear	1148

while other portions were to be scaled down	O O O O O O O O	fear	1169
and there was to be a false or pre-arranged failure to pass the bill at one session in order to frighten off the outsiders who might have heard and begun to buy the old certificates for profit	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O B-EMO I-EMO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1169
He acquainted the Third National Bank with this fact	O O O O O O O O O	fear	1169
and of course the information came to Cowperwood as teller.	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1169
"""Why"	O	surprise	1171
Nancy Arabella	O O	surprise	1171

"""you haven't grown an inch"	O O O O O	surprise	1171

But look at you	O O O O	surprise	1171
I swear to Heaven you don't weigh five pounds	O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1171
And he jounced her up and down by the waist	O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1171
much to the perturbation of the children	O O O O O O O	surprise	1171
who had never before seen their mother so familiarly handled.	O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1171
Measuring twenty by twenty-four and finished in imitation cherry	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1172
with a set of new Sheraton parlor furniture it presented a quaintly harmonious aspect	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1172
Since Henry had become teller the family had acquired a piano--a decided luxury in those days-- brought from Europe	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1172
and it was intended that Anna Adelaide	O O O O O O O	happiness	1172
when she was old enough	O O O O O	happiness	1172
should learn to play	O O O O	happiness	1172
There were a few uncommon ornaments in the room--a gas chandelier for one thing	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1172
a glass bowl with goldfish in it	O O O O O O O	happiness	1172
some rare and highly polished shells	O O O O O O	happiness	1172
and a marble Cupid bearing a basket of flowers	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1172
It was summer time	O O O O	happiness	1172
the windows were open	O O O O	happiness	1172
and the trees outside	O O O O	happiness	1172
with their widely extended green branches	O O O O O O	happiness	1172
were pleasantly visible shading the brick sidewalk	O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1172
Uncle Seneca strolled out into the back yard.	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1172
Young Cowperwood's mind was working	O O O O O	disgust	1173
He had no money with him	O O O O O O	disgust	1173
but his father was teller of the Third National Bank	O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1173
and he could quote him as reference	O O O O O O O	disgust	1173
He could sell all of his soap to the family grocer	O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1173
surely	O	disgust	1173
or	O	disgust	1173
if not	O O	disgust	1173
to other grocers	O O O	disgust	1173
Other people were anxious to get this soap at this price	O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	1173
Why not he	O O O	disgust	1173
He was	O O	happiness	1175
to look at	O O O	happiness	1175
a phlegmatic type of man--short	O O O O O	happiness	1175
stout	O	happiness	1175
wrinkled about the eyes	O O O O	happiness	1175
rather protuberant as to stomach	O O O O O	happiness	1175
red-necked	O	happiness	1175
red-faced	O	happiness	1175
the least bit popeyed	O O O O	happiness	1175
but shrewd	O O	happiness	1175
kindly	O	happiness	1175
good-natured	O	happiness	1175
and witty	O O	happiness	1175
He had	O O	happiness	1175
because of his naturally common-sense ideas and rather pleasing disposition built up a sound and successful business here	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1175
He was getting strong in years and would gladly have welcomed the hearty cooperation of his son	O O O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O O O O O O	happiness	1175
if the latter had been entirely suited to the business.	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1175
Then came young Cowperwood	O O O O	happiness	1176
spoken of to him by Seneca Davis	O O O O O O O	happiness	1176
He looked him over critically	O O O O O	happiness	1176
Yes	O	happiness	1176
this boy might do	O O O O	happiness	1176
he thought	O O	happiness	1176
There was something easy and sufficient about him	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1176
He did not appear to be in the least flustered or disturbed	O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1176
He knew how to keep books	O O O O O O	happiness	1176
he said	O O	happiness	1176
though he knew nothing of the details of the grain and commission business	O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1176
It was interesting to him	O O B-EMO O O	happiness	1176
He would like to try it.	O O O O O O	happiness	1176
The Watermans	O O	happiness	1179
Henry and George	O O O	happiness	1179
were greatly pleased with the way he handled their accounts	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1179
There was a sense of security in his very presence	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1179
He soon began to call Brother George's attention to the condition of certain accounts	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1179
making suggestions as to their possible liquidation or discontinuance	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1179
which pleased that individual greatly	O B-EMO O O O	happiness	1179
He saw a way of lightening his own labors through the intelligence of this youth	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1179
while at the same time developing a sense of pleasant companionship with him.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1179
Cowperwood smiled his hearty	O O O O	happiness	1182
genial smile	O O	happiness	1182
He was feeling very comfortable under this evidence of approval	O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1182
He looked bright and cheery in his well-made clothes of English tweed.	O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1182
On the way home that evening he speculated as to the nature of this business	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1185
He knew he wasn't going to stay there long	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1185
even in spite of this gift and promise of salary	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1185
They were grateful	O O B-EMO	happiness	1185
of course	O O	happiness	1185
but why shouldn't they be	O O O O O	happiness	1185
He was efficient	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1185
he knew that	O O O	happiness	1185
under him things moved smoothly	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1185
It never occurred to him that he belonged in the realm of clerkdom.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1185
It was only two weeks later that Frank took his departure from Waterman & Company	O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	1189
interested and yet in no way flustered by his new prospects	O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1189
And great was the grief of Mr	O O O O O O O	anger	1189
George Waterman	O O	anger	1189
As for Mr	O O O	anger	1189
Henry Waterman	O O	anger	1189
he was actually irritated by this defection.	O O O B-EMO O O O	anger	1189
"""I know it"	O O O	fear	1191
""" smiled Cowperwood"	O O O	fear	1191
"""but I don't like it"	O O O O O	fear	1191
I have other plans in view	O O O O O O	fear	1191
I'll never be a grain and commission man	O O O O O O O O	fear	1191
Henry Waterman could scarcely understand why obvious success in this field did not interest him	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1191
He feared the effect of his departure on the business.	O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1191
The occasion of the meeting was an evening call on the part of the Semples	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1193
Mr	O	happiness	1193
Semple being desirous of talking with Henry Cowperwood concerning a new transportation feature which was then entering the world--namely	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1193
street-cars	O	happiness	1193
A tentative line	O O O	happiness	1193
incorporated by the North Pennsylvania Railway Company	O O O O O O O	happiness	1193
had been put into operation on a mile and a half of tracks extending from Willow Street along Front to Germantown Road	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1193
and thence by various streets to what was then known as the Cohocksink Depot	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1193
and it was thought that in time this mode of locomotion might drive out the hundreds of omnibuses which now crowded and made impassable the downtown streets	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1193
Young Cowperwood had been greatly interested from the start	O O O O B-EMO I-EMO O O O	happiness	1193
Railway transportation	O O	happiness	1193
as a whole	O O O	happiness	1193
interested him	O O	happiness	1193
anyway	O	happiness	1193
but this particular phase was most fascinating.	O O O O O O O	happiness	1193
There was great talk concerning morality	O O O O O O	disgust	1196
much praise of virtue and decency	O O O O O O	disgust	1196
and much lifting of hands in righteous horror at people who broke or were even rumored to have broken the Seventh Commandment	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1196
He did not take this talk seriously	O O O O O O O	disgust	1196
Already he had broken it secretly many times	O O O O O O O O	disgust	1196
Other young men did	O O O O	disgust	1196
Yet again	O O	disgust	1196
he was a little sick of the women of the streets and the bagnio	O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	1196
There were too many coarse	O O O O O	disgust	1196
evil features in connection with such contacts.	O O O O O O O	disgust	1196
At first	O O	happiness	1198
when Frank called	O O O	happiness	1198
she did not have much to say	O O O O O O O	happiness	1198
She was gracious	O O O	happiness	1198
but the burden of conversation fell on her husband	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1198
Cowperwood watched the varying expression of her face from time to time	O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1198
and if she had been at all psychic she must have felt something	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1198
Fortunately she was not	O O O O	happiness	1198
Semple talked to him pleasantly	O O O O B-EMO	happiness	1198
because in the first place Frank was becoming financially significant	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1198
was suave and ingratiating	O O O O	happiness	1198
and in the next place he was anxious to get richer and somehow Frank represented progress to him in that line	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1198
One spring evening they sat on the porch and talked--nothing very important--slavery	O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1198
street-cars	O	happiness	1198
the panic--it was on then	O O O O O	happiness	1198
that of 1857--the development of the West.	O O O O O O O	happiness	1198
Thereafter	O	happiness	1200
for a year or so	O O O O O	happiness	1200
Cowperwood bought his shoes of Mr	O O O O O O	happiness	1200
Semple	O	happiness	1200
Occasionally also he stopped in the Chestnut Street store to exchange the time of the day	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1200
Semple asked his opinion as to the advisability of buying some shares in the Fifth and Sixth Street line	O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1200
which	O	happiness	1200
having secured a franchise	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1200
was creating great excitement	O O O B-EMO	happiness	1200
Cowperwood gave him his best judgment	O O O O O O	happiness	1200
It was sure to be profitable	O O O O O O	happiness	1200
He himself had purchased one hundred shares at five dollars a share	O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1200
and urged Semple to do so	O O O O O O	happiness	1200
But he was not interested in him personally	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1200
He liked Mrs	O O O	happiness	1200
Semple	O	happiness	1200
though he did not see her very often.	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1200
He could not think of her reasonably	O O O O O O O	happiness	1201
and he did not talk of her much to any one	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1201
His family knew that he went to see her	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1201
but there had grown up in the Cowperwood family a deep respect for the mental force of Frank	O O O O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1201
He was genial	O O O	happiness	1201
cheerful	O	happiness	1201
gay at most times	O O O O	happiness	1201
without being talkative	O O O	happiness	1201
and he was decidedly successful	O O O O O	happiness	1201
Everybody knew he was making money now	O O O O O O O	happiness	1201
His salary was fifty dollars a week	O O O O O O O	happiness	1201
and he was certain soon to get more.	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1201
There was a long conversation--a long wait	O O O O O O O	disgust	1203
His father came back to say it was doubtful whether they could make the loan	O O O O O O O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	1203
Eight per cent	O O O	disgust	1203
then being secured for money	O O O O O	disgust	1203
was a small rate of interest	O O O O O O	disgust	1203
considering its need.	O O O	disgust	1203
In spite of her fears and her uncertainty	O O O O O O O O	sadness	1206
Lillian Semple accepted his attentions and interest because	O O O O O O O O	sadness	1206
equally in spite of herself	O O O O O	sadness	1206
she was drawn to him	O O O O O	sadness	1206
One night	O O	sadness	1206
when she was going to bed	O O O O O O	sadness	1206
she stopped in front of her dressing table and looked at her face and her bare neck and arms	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1206
They were very pretty	O O O O	sadness	1206
A subtle something came over her as she surveyed her long	O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1206
peculiarly shaded hair	O O O	sadness	1206
She thought of young Cowperwood	O O O O O	sadness	1206
and then was chilled and shamed by the vision of the late Mr	O O O B-EMO O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1206
Semple and the force and quality of public opinion.	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1206
"""I'll put you down"	O O O O	happiness	1209

He was very much aroused	O O O O O	happiness	1209
excited.	B-EMO	happiness	1209
"""Oh"	O	happiness	1211
""" she sighed"	O O O	happiness	1211
falling limp on his shoulder when he refused to let her go	O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1211
Then	O	happiness	1211
because of the set determination of his face	O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1211
some intense pull in him	O O O O O	happiness	1211
she smiled	O B-EMO	happiness	1211
"""How would I ever explain if I did marry you"	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1211

Cowperwood had implicit faith in the future of the street railway	O O B-EMO I-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1214
In support of this belief he risked all he could spare on new issues of stock shares in new companies	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1214
He wanted to be on the inside wherever possible	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1214
always	O	happiness	1214
though this was a little difficult in the matter of the street-railways	O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1214
he having been so young when they started and not having yet arranged his financial connections to make them count for much.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1214
The home atmosphere which they established when they returned from their honeymoon was a great improvement in taste over that which had characterized the earlier life of Mrs	O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1217

Semple	O	happiness	1217
They had decided to occupy her house	O O O O O O O	happiness	1217
on North Front Street	O O O O	happiness	1217
for a while at least.	O O O O O	happiness	1217
Those who recall the early years of their married life can best realize the subtle changes which this new condition brought to Frank	O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1219
for	O	happiness	1219
like all who accept the hymeneal yoke	O O O O O O O	happiness	1219
he was influenced to a certain extent by the things with which he surrounded himself	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1219
Primarily	O	happiness	1219
from certain traits of his character	O O O O O O	happiness	1219
one would have imagined him called to be a citizen of eminent respectability and worth	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1219
He appeared to be an ideal home man	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1219
He delighted to return to his wife in the evenings	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1219
leaving the crowded downtown section where traffic clamored and men hurried	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1219
Here he could feel that he was well-stationed and physically happy in life	O O O O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO O O	happiness	1219
The thought of the dinner-table with candles upon it (his idea)	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1219
the thought of Lillian in a trailing gown of pale-blue or green silk--he liked her in those colors	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1219
the thought of a large fireplace flaming with solid lengths of cord-wood	O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1219
and Lillian snuggling in his arms	O O O O O O	happiness	1219
gripped his immature imagination	O O O O	happiness	1219
As has been said before	O O O O O	happiness	1219
he cared nothing for books	O O O O O	happiness	1219
but life	O O	happiness	1219
pictures	O	happiness	1219

physical contact--these	O O	happiness	1219
in spite of his shrewd and already gripping financial calculations	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1219
held him	O O	happiness	1219
To live richly	O O O	happiness	1219
joyously	O	happiness	1219
fully--his whole nature craved that.	O O O O O	happiness	1219
And Mrs	O O	happiness	1223
Cowperwood	O	happiness	1223
in spite of the difference in their years	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1223
appeared to be a fit mate for him at this time	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1223
She was once awakened	O O O O	happiness	1223
and for the time being	O O O O O	happiness	1223
clinging	O	happiness	1223
responsive	O	happiness	1223
dreamy	O	happiness	1223
His mood and hers was for a baby	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1223
and in a little while that happy expectation was whispered to him by her	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1223
She had half fancied that her previous barrenness was due to herself	O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1223
and was rather surprised and delighted at the proof that it was not so	O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1223
It opened new possibilities--a seemingly glorious future of which she was not afraid	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1223
He liked it	O O O	happiness	1223
the idea of self-duplication.	O O O O	happiness	1223
There was so much to think of in this connection--the spermatozoic beginning	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1224
the strange period of gestation in women	O O O O O O O	fear	1224
the danger of disease and delivery	O O O O O O	fear	1224

Then word came	O O O	fear	1225
after certain piercing	O O O	fear	1225
harrowing cries	O O	fear	1225
that all was well	O O O O	fear	1225
and he was permitted to look at the new arrival.	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1225
The children took up a great deal of her time	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1227
However	O	happiness	1227
Cowperwood was not troubled about this	O O O O O O	happiness	1227
It struck him as delightful and exceedingly worth while that she should be so devoted	O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1227
At the same time	O O O O	happiness	1227
her lethargic manner	O O O	happiness	1227
vague smile and her sometimes seeming indifference	O O O O O O O	happiness	1227
which sprang largely from a sense of absolute security	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1227
attracted him also.	O O O	happiness	1227
Then came meetings	O O O	fear	1228
public and stirring	O O O	fear	1228

the incident of John Brown's body	O O O O O O	fear	1228

the battle of Gettysburg	O O O O	fear	1228
and so on	O O O	fear	1228
Cowperwood was only twenty-five at the time	O O O O O O O	fear	1228
a cool	O O	fear	1228
determined youth	O O	fear	1228
who thought the slave agitation might be well founded in human rights--no doubt was --but exceedingly dangerous to trade	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO O O	fear	1228
He hoped the North would win	O O O O O O	fear	1228
but it might go hard with him personally and other financiers	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1228
He did not care to fight	O O O O O O	fear	1228
That seemed silly for the individual man to do.	O O O O O O O O O	fear	1228
This current war-spirit was strange	O O O O O	fear	1230
The people seemed to him to want to hear nothing but the sound of the drum and fife	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1230
to see nothing but troops	O O O O O	fear	1230
of which there were thousands now passing through on their way to the front	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1230
carrying cold steel in the shape of guns at their shoulders	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1230
to hear of war and the rumors of war	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1230
It was a thrilling sentiment	O O O B-EMO O	fear	1230
no doubt	O O	fear	1230
great but unprofitable	O O O	fear	1230
It meant self-sacrifice	O O O	fear	1230
and he could not see that	O O O O O O	fear	1230
If he went he might be shot	O O O O O O O	fear	1230
and what would his noble emotion amount to then	O O O O O O O O O	fear	1230
He would rather make money	O O O O O	fear	1230
regulate current political	O O O	fear	1230
social and financial affairs	O O O O	fear	1230
The poor fool who fell in behind the enlisting squad--no	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1230
not fool	O O	fear	1230
he would not call him that--the poor overwrought working-man--well	O O O O O O O O O	fear	1230
Heaven pity him	O O O	fear	1230
Heaven pity all of them	O O O O O	fear	1230
They really did not know what they were doing.	O O O O O O O O O	fear	1230
"""I happen to be interested just at present in pickin' up certain street-railway stocks on 'change"	O O O O B-EMO O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1231

Won't you have somethin' to drink	O O O O O O	happiness	1231
"It's a cold morning."""	O O O O	happiness	1231
Cowperwood	O	happiness	1232
warm with this enhancing of his financial prospects	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1232
went down the steps	O O O O	happiness	1232
but incidentally he spared a passing thought for the gay spirit of youth that had manifested itself in this red-cheeked maiden	O O O O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1232
What a bright	O O O	happiness	1232

bounding girl	O O	happiness	1232
Her voice had the subtle	O O O O O	happiness	1232
vigorous ring of fifteen or sixteen	O O O O O O	happiness	1232
She was all vitality	O O O O	happiness	1232
What a fine catch for some young fellow some day	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1232
and her father would make him rich	O O O O O O O	happiness	1232
no doubt	O O	happiness	1232
or help to.	O O O	happiness	1232
And Cowperwood felt confident when he left the house that evening that Butler would not fail him but would set the wheels working	O O B-EMO I-EMO O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1233
Therefore	O	happiness	1233
he was not surprised	O O O O	happiness	1233
and knew exactly what it meant	O O O O O O	happiness	1233
when a few days later he was introduced to City Treasurer Julian Bode	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1233
who promised to introduce him to State Treasurer Van Nostrand and to see that his claims to consideration were put before the people	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1233
"""Of course"	O O	happiness	1233

in the presence of Butler	O O O O O	happiness	1233

"""this banking crowd is very powerful"	O O O O O O	happiness	1233

He went away thinking how surprised Drexel & Co	O O O O O B-EMO O O O	surprise	1234
and Cooke & Co	O O O O	surprise	1234
would be to see him appearing in the field as a competitor	O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1234

which he had fixed up as an office with a desk	O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1234
a safe	O O	surprise	1234
and a leather chair	O O O O	surprise	1234
he consulted his resources.	O O O O	surprise	1234
She had already learned that the Butlers were rather showy--the younger generation--that they were sensitive as to their lineage	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1235
and that money in their estimation was supposed to make up for any deficiency in any other respect	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1235

She was no longer as softly pleasing	O O O O O O O	fear	1236

In short she was a little run down nervously and suffered from fits of depression	O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO	sadness	1237
Cowperwood had noticed this	O O O O	sadness	1237
He tried to be gentle and considerate	O O O O O O O	sadness	1237
but he was too much of a utilitarian and practical-minded observer not to realize that he was likely to have a sickly wife on his hands later.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1237
He was not at all sure	O O O O O O	disgust	1240
for instance	O O	disgust	1240
that the negroes could be made into anything much more significant than they were	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1240
At any rate	O O O	disgust	1240
it was a long uphill struggle for them	O O O O O O O O	disgust	1240
of which many future generations would not witness the conclusion	O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1240
He had no particular quarrel with the theory that they should be free	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1240
he saw no particular reason why the South should not protest vigorously against the destruction of their property and their system	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1240
It was too bad that the negroes as slaves should be abused in some instances	O O B-EMO I-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	1240
He felt sure that that ought to be adjusted in some way	O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1240
but beyond that he could not see that there was any great ethical basis for the contentions of their sponsors.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1240
He was not of those who complained bitterly of the excessive war taxes	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1242
though he knew them to be trying to many	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1242
Some of the stories of death and disaster moved him greatly	O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1242
but	O	sadness	1242
alas	O	sadness	1242
they were among the unaccountable fortunes of life	O O O O O O O O	sadness	1242
and could not be remedied by him	O O O O O O O	sadness	1242
So he had gone his way day by day	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1242
watching the coming in and the departing of troops	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1242

disheveled	O	sadness	1242

and all he could do was to feel sorry	O O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO	sadness	1242
This war was not for him	O O O O O O	sadness	1242
He had taken no part in it	O O O O O O O	sadness	1242
and he felt sure that he could only rejoice in its conclusion--not as a patriot	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1242
but as a financier	O O O O	sadness	1242
It was wasteful	O O O	sadness	1242
pathetic	O	sadness	1242
unfortunate.	O	sadness	1242
Intelligence	O	happiness	1247
of a raw	O O O	happiness	1247
crude order she had certainly--also a native force	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1247
tamed somewhat by the doctrines and conventions of current society	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1247
still showed clear at times in an elemental and not entirely unattractive way	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1247

She supplied something he had not previously known or consciously craved	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1247
Vitality and vivacity.	O O O	happiness	1247
But these facts of wealth and advantage gripped her	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU B-EMO I-EMO	fear	1248
and when she sat at the piano and played or rode in her carriage or walked or stood before her mirror	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1248
she was conscious of her figure	O O O O O O	fear	1248
her charms	O O	fear	1248
what they meant to men	O O O O O	fear	1248
how women envied her	O O O O	fear	1248
Sometimes she looked at poor	O O O O O	fear	1248
hollow-chested or homely-faced girls and felt sorry for them	O O O O O O O O O	fear	1248
at other times she flared into inexplicable opposition to some handsome girl or woman who dared to brazen her socially or physically.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1248

She would just have to wait	O O O O O O	anger	1258
Marriage was the answer--the right marriage	O O O O O O	anger	1258
But whom was she to marry	O O O O O O	anger	1258
It was curious	O O O	anger	1259
though	O	anger	1259
that it was Aileen who commanded nearly all their attention and fixed their minds on her so-called idiosyncrasies	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1259
All they said was in its peculiar way true	O O O O O O O O O	anger	1259
but in addition the girl was really beautiful and much above the average intelligence and force	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1259
She was running deep with ambition	O O O O O O	anger	1259
and she was all the more conspicuous	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	1259
and in a way irritating to some	O O O O B-EMO O O	anger	1259
because she reflected in her own consciousness her social defects	O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1259
against which she was inwardly fighting	O O O O O O	anger	1259
She resented the fact that people could justly consider her parents ineligible	O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1259
and for that reason her also.	O O O O O O	anger	1259

He was not especially poetic	O O O O O	happiness	1264
He had not formulated the phrase beforehand	O O O O O O O	happiness	1264
Since his first glimpse of her in the hall	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1264
his feelings and ideas had been leaping and plunging like spirited horses	O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O	happiness	1264
This girl made him set his teeth and narrow his eyes	O O O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO	happiness	1264
Involuntarily he squared his jaw	O O O O O	happiness	1264
looking more defiant	O O O	happiness	1264
forceful	O	happiness	1264

as she drew near	O O O O	happiness	1264
And then she came to the matter of a train-gown	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1267
Kathleen laid out five	O O O O	happiness	1267
for Aileen had come into the joy and honor of these things recently	O O O O O O O O B-EMO O O O O	happiness	1267
and she had	O O O	happiness	1267
with the permission of her mother and father	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1267
indulged herself to the full	O O O O O	happiness	1267
She studied a golden-yellow silk	O O O O O	happiness	1267
with cream-lace shoulder-straps	O O O	happiness	1267
and some gussets of garnet beads in the train that shimmered delightfully	O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1267
but set it aside.	O O O O	happiness	1267
Then she put on the black silk with its glistening crimsoned-silver sequins	O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1268
and	O	happiness	1268
lo	O	happiness	1268
it touched her	O O O	happiness	1268
She liked its coquettish drapery of tulle and silver about the hips	O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1268

Then after having Kathleen tighten her corsets a little more	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1268
she gathered the train over her arm by its train-band and looked again	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1268

of beautiful if raw	O O O O	happiness	1269

She was so young	O O O O	happiness	1269
She was beautiful	O O O	happiness	1269

and in spite of his wife's repeated derogatory comments he felt that she was nearer to his clear	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1269

she conceived of him as something quite wonderful	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1272

"""I satisfy myself"	O O O	anger	1284
""" was his motto"	O O O O	anger	1284

But this matter of Aileen was up for consideration and solution at this present moment	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1285
and because of his forceful	O O O O O	disgust	1285
determined character he was presently not at all disturbed by the problem it presented	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1285
It was a problem	O O O O	disgust	1285
like some of those knotty financial complications which presented themselves daily	O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1285
but it was not insoluble	O O O O O	disgust	1285
What did he want to do	O O O O O O	disgust	1285
He couldn't leave his wife and fly with Aileen	O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1285
that was certain	O O O	disgust	1285
He had too many connections	O O O O O	disgust	1285
He had too many social	O O O O O	disgust	1285
and thinking of his children and parents	O O O O O O O	disgust	1285
emotional as well as financial ties to bind him	O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1285
Besides	O	disgust	1285
he was not at all sure that he wanted to	O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO	disgust	1285
He did not intend to leave his growing interests	O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1285

The unheralded manifestation of interest on her part was too attractive.	O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1285
At the same time	O O O O	disgust	1287
in contemplating his wife in connection with all this	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	1287
he had many qualms	O O O O	disgust	1287
some emotional	O B-EMO	disgust	1287
some financial	O O	disgust	1287
While she had yielded to his youthful enthusiasm for her after her husband's death	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1287
he had only since learned that she was a natural conservator of public morals--the cold purity of the snowdrift in so far as the world might see	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1287
combined at times with the murky mood of the wanton.	O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1287
And yet	O O	sadness	1288
as he had also learned	O O O O O	sadness	1288
she was ashamed of the passion that at times swept and dominated her	O O B-EMO I-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1288
This irritated Cowperwood	O O O	sadness	1288
as it would always irritate any strong	O O O O O O O	sadness	1288
acquisitive	O	sadness	1288
direct-seeing temperament	O O	sadness	1288
While he had no desire to acquaint the whole world with his feelings	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1288
why should there be concealment between them	O O O O O O O	sadness	1288
or at least mental evasion of a fact which physically she subscribed to	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1288
Why do one thing and think another	O O O O O O O	sadness	1288
At the same time	O O O O	anger	1290

To be sure	O O O	anger	1290
she was devoted to him in her quiet way	O O O O O O O O O	anger	1290
not passionately (as he looked back he could not say that she had ever been that)	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1290
but intellectually	O O	anger	1290
Duty	O	anger	1290
as she understood it	O O O O	anger	1290
played a great part in this.	O O O O O O	anger	1290
It is a question as to what would have happened if antagonistic forces could have been introduced just at this time	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1295
Emotions and liaisons of this character can	O O O O O O O	fear	1295
of course	O O	fear	1295
occasionally be broken up and destroyed	O O O O O O	fear	1295
The characters of the individuals can be modified or changed to a certain extent	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1295
but the force must be quite sufficient	O O O O O O O	fear	1295
Fear is a great deterrent--fear of material loss where there is no spiritual dread--but wealth and position so often tend to destroy this dread	O O O O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1295
It is so easy to scheme with means	O O O O O O O O	fear	1295
Aileen had no spiritual dread whatever	O O O O O O	fear	1295
Cowperwood was without spiritual or religious feeling	O O O O O O O	fear	1295
He looked at this girl	O O O O O	fear	1295
and his one thought was how could he so deceive the world that he could enjoy her love and leave his present state undisturbed	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O O O O O O O O	fear	1295
Love her he did surely.	O O O O O	fear	1295
And as for safeguards against the production of new life--they were not mysteries to him any longer	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1296
He knew all about them	O O O O O	fear	1296
Care was the point of caution	O O O O O O	fear	1296
He had to be cautious	O O O O B-EMO	fear	1296
for he was so rapidly coming to be an influential and a distinguished man	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1296
Aileen	O	fear	1296
of course	O O	fear	1296
was not conscious	O O O	fear	1296
except in a vague way	O O O O O	fear	1296
of the drift of her passion	O O O O O O	fear	1296
the ultimate destiny to which this affection might lead was not clear to her	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1296
Her craving was for love--to be fondled and caressed--and she really did not think so much further	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1296
Further thoughts along this line were like rats that showed their heads out of dark holes in shadowy corners and scuttled back at the least sound	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1296
And	O	fear	1296
anyhow	O	fear	1296
all that was to be connected with Cowperwood would be beautiful	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1296
She really did not think that he loved her yet as he should	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1296
but he would	O O O	fear	1296
She did not know that she wanted to interfere with the claims of his wife	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1296
She did not think she did	O O O O O O	fear	1296
But it would not hurt Mrs	O O O O O O	fear	1296

for the time being there was love-making	O O O O O O O	happiness	1297

and the lovely horseback rides together under the green trees of the approaching spring were idyllic	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1297
Cowperwood awakened to a sense of joy in life such as he fancied	O O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O O O O O O	happiness	1297
in the blush of this new desire	O O O O O O O	happiness	1297
he had never experienced before	O O O O O	happiness	1297
Lillian had been lovely in those early days in which he had first called on her in North Front Street	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1297
and he had fancied himself unspeakably happy at that time	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1297
but that was nearly ten years since	O O O O O O O	happiness	1297
and he had forgotten.	O O O O	happiness	1297
He paused	O O	happiness	1300
She still gazed thoughtfully at the water below	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1300
her mind running out to a yacht on the sea with him	O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1300
a palace somewhere-- just they two	O O O O O O	happiness	1300
Her eyes	O O	happiness	1300

saw this happy world	O O O O	happiness	1300
and	O	happiness	1300
listening to him	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1300
she was fascinated.	O O B-EMO	happiness	1300
Mrs	O	happiness	1301
Cowperwood might die	O O O	happiness	1301
or he might run away with her at thirty-five when he had a million	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1301
Some adjustment would be made	O O O O O	happiness	1301
somehow	O	happiness	1301
Nature had given her this man	O O O O O O	happiness	1301
She relied on him implicitly	O O O O O	happiness	1301
When he told her that he would take care of her so that nothing evil should befall	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1301
she believed him fully	O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO	happiness	1301
Such sins are the commonplaces of the confessional.	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1301
That the modern home is the most beautiful of schemes	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1302
when based upon mutual sympathy and understanding between two	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1302
need not be questioned	O O O O	happiness	1302
And yet this fact should not necessarily carry with it a condemnation of all love not so fortunate as to find so happy a denouement	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1302
Life cannot be put into any mold	O O O O O O O	happiness	1302
and the attempt might as well be abandoned at once	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1302
Those so fortunate as to find harmonious companionship for life should congratulate themselves and strive to be worthy of it	O O B-EMO O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1302
Those not so blessed	O O O O	happiness	1302
though they be written down as pariahs	O O O O O O O	happiness	1302
have yet some justification	O O O O	happiness	1302
And	O	happiness	1302

Like is drawn to like.	O O O O O	happiness	1302
These two felt unutterably bound to each other	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1303
Cowperwood	O	happiness	1303
once he came to understand her	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1303
fancied that he had found the one person with whom he could live happily the rest of his life	O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O O O O O	happiness	1303
She was so young	O O O O	happiness	1303
so confident	O O	happiness	1303
so hopeful	O O	happiness	1303
so undismayed	O O	happiness	1303
All these months since they had first begun to reach out to each other he had been hourly contrasting her with his wife.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1303
As it was he was constantly watching the certificates of loan issue	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1305
for the city treasury	O O O O	fear	1305
--buying large quantities when the market was falling to protect it and selling heavily	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1305
though cautiously	O O	fear	1305
when he saw it rising and to do this he had to have a great deal of free money to permit him to do it	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1305
He was constantly fearful of some break in the market which would affect the value of all his securities and result in the calling of his loans	O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1305
There was no storm in sight	O O O O O O	fear	1305
He did not see that anything could happen in reason	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1305
but he did not want to spread himself out too thin.	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1305
Things had changed considerably for him since the days when he had been fortuitously and almost indifferently made city treasurer	O O O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1306
His method of dressing had so much improved since he had been inducted into office	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1306
and his manner expressed so much more good feeling	O O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO	happiness	1306
confidence	O	happiness	1306
aplomb	O	happiness	1306
that he would not have recognized himself if he had been permitted to see himself as had those who had known him before.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1306
His one pet idea	O O O O	fear	1309
the thing he put more faith in than anything else	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1309
was his street-railway manipulations	O O O O	fear	1309
and particularly his actual control of the Seventeenth and Nineteenth Street line	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1309
Through an advance to him	O O O O O	fear	1309
on deposit	O O	fear	1309
made in his bank by Stener at a time when the stock of the Seventeenth and Nineteenth Street line was at a low ebb	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1309
he had managed to pick up fifty-one per cent	O O O O O O O O O	fear	1309
of the stock for himself and Stener	O O O O O O O	fear	1309
by virtue of which he was able to do as he pleased with the road	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1309
To accomplish this	O O O	fear	1309
however	O	fear	1309
"he had resorted to some very ""peculiar"" methods"	O O O O O O O O	fear	1309
as they afterward came to be termed in financial circles	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1309
to get this stock at his own valuation	O O O O O O O O	fear	1309
Through agents he caused suits for damages to be brought against the company for non-payment of interest due	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1309
A little stock in the hands of a hireling	O O O O O O O O O	fear	1309
a request made to a court of record to examine the books of the company in order to determine whether a receivership were not advisable	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1309
a simultaneous attack in the stock market	O O O O O O O	fear	1309
selling at three	O O O	fear	1309
five	O	fear	1309
seven	O	fear	1309
and ten points off	O O O O	fear	1309
brought the frightened stockholders into the market with their holdings	O O B-EMO O O O O O O O	fear	1309
The banks considered the line a poor risk	O O O O O O O O	fear	1309
and called their loans in connection with it.	O O O O O O O O	fear	1309
This intoxicated him	O B-EMO O	happiness	1310
for immediately he saw the opportunity of fulfilling his long-contemplated dream--that of reorganizing the company in conjunction with the North Pennsylvania line	O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1310
issuing three shares where one had been before and after unloading all but a control on the general public	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1310
using the money secured to buy into other lines which were to be boomed and sold in the same way	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1310
In short	O O	happiness	1310
he was one of those early	O O O O O O	happiness	1310
daring manipulators who later were to seize upon other and ever larger phases of American natural development for their own aggrandizement.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1310
However	O	happiness	1312
by the spring and summer of 1871	O O O O O O O	happiness	1312
Cowperwood had actually	O O O	happiness	1312
without being in any conceivable danger from any source	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1312
spread himself out very thin	O O O O O	happiness	1312
Because of his great success he had grown more liberal--easier--in his financial ventures	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1312
By degrees	O O	happiness	1312
and largely because of his own confidence in himself	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1312
he had induced his father to enter upon his street-car speculations	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1312
to use the resources of the Third National to carry a part of his loans and to furnish capital at such times as quick resources were necessary	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1312
In the beginning the old gentleman had been a little nervous and skeptical	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1312
but as time had worn on and nothing but profit eventuated	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1312
he grew bolder and more confident.	O O O O B-EMO I-EMO	happiness	1312
Then	O	surprise	1315
after several years of this secret relationship	O O O O O O O	surprise	1315
in which the ties of sympathy and understanding grew stronger instead of weaker	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1315
came the storm	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1315
It burst unexpectedly and out of a clear sky	O O B-EMO O O O O O O	surprise	1315
and bore no relation to the intention or volition of any individual	O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1315
It was nothing more than a fire	O O O O O O O	surprise	1315
a distant one--the great Chicago fire	O O O O O O	surprise	1315
October 7th	O O	surprise	1315
1871	O	surprise	1315
which burned that city-- its vast commercial section--to the ground	O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1315
and instantly and incidentally produced a financial panic	O O O O O O O O	surprise	1315
vicious though of short duration in various other cities in America.	O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1315
Cowperwood	O	fear	1316
Sr	O	fear	1316
was already plucking at his side-whiskers in a confused and troubled way	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1316
He was cogitating as to what might happen to him in case his son failed	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1316
for he was deeply involved with him	O O O O O O O	fear	1316
He was a little gray in his complexion now	O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O O O O	fear	1316
frightened	O	fear	1316
for he had already strained many points in his affairs to accommodate his son	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1316

the onus and scandal of the situation would be on him.	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1316

Owen was running swiftly in his mind over Cowperwood's affairs--as much as he knew of them	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1320
He felt keenly that the banker ought to be shaken out	O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1320
This dilemma was his fault	O O O O O	surprise	1320
not Stener's--he felt	O O O	surprise	1320

He was of a domestic turn of mind	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1321
Still	O	happiness	1321
Sunday evening being an excellent one for conference purposes generally in the world of politics	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1321
he was not without the thought that some one or other of his distinguished confreres might call	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1321
and when the combination footman and butler announced the presence of Butler and his son	O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1321
he was well pleased.	O O B-EMO I-EMO	happiness	1321
He hurried down the street to various bankers and brokers suggesting that they do this--close the exchange	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1324
At a few minutes before twelve o'clock he drove rapidly to the station to meet Stener	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1324
but to his great disappointment the latter did not arrive	O O O B-EMO I-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1324
It looked as though he had missed his train	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1324
Cowperwood sensed something	O O O	sadness	1324
some trick	O O	sadness	1324
and decided to go to the city hall and also to Stener's house	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1324
Perhaps he had returned and was trying to avoid him.	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1324
Stener	O	fear	1325
as he saw him now	O O O O O	fear	1325
was a pawn in whosoever's hands he happened to be at the time	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1325
and despite Mr	O O O	fear	1325

And so he stood there looking at him as might a snake at a bird determined to galvanize him into selfish self-interest if possible	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1325
But Stener was so frightened that at the moment it looked as though there was little to be done with him	O O O B-EMO I-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1325

as a matter of fact	O O O O O	fear	1332
his very financial blood was oozing away	O O O O O O O	fear	1332

why	O	anger	1478

This made her angry	O O O B-EMO	anger	1478
She shouted at me	O O O O	anger	1478

Many loudly blamed the King for not keeping the roads clear	O O B-EMO O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	1483

the matter is beyond controversy	O O O O O	surprise	1484
but when we come to consider the incidents of the story	O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1484
we find deviations from Homer even more serious than any of those from the Cyclic poets	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1484
And the strange thing is	O O B-EMO O O	surprise	1484
that each of these deviations is a manifest detriment to the perfection of his poem	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1484

Now	O	fear	1489
it is just in describing such natural phenomena	O O O O O O O O	fear	1489
and in blending them with the turmoil of battle	O O O O O O O O O	fear	1489
that Quintus is in his element	O O O O O O	fear	1489
yet for such a scene he substitutes what is	O O O O O O O O O	fear	1489
by comparison	O O	fear	1489
a lame and impotent conclusion	O O O O O	fear	1489
Of that awful cry that rang over the sea heralding the coming of Thetis and the Nymphs to the death-rites of her son	O O B-EMO O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1489

Quintus is silent.	O O O	fear	1489
Again	O	fear	1490
"Homer (""Odyssey"" iv"	O O O	fear	1490

Howbeit the victims burned not	O O O O O	happiness	1645

15th (Lord's day)	O O O	happiness	1673
To sermon	O O	happiness	1673
and then to dinner	O O O O	happiness	1673
where my Lord told us that the University of Cambridge had a mind to choose him for their burgess	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1673
which he pleased himself with	O O B-EMO O O	happiness	1673
to think that they do look upon him as a thriving man	O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1673
and said so openly at table.	O O O O O O	happiness	1673
The chief is that	O O O O	fear	1674
that I had from Mr	O O O O O	fear	1674
Moore	O	fear	1674
viz	O	fear	1674
that he fears the Cavaliers in the House will be so high	O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1674
that the other will be forced to leave the House and fall in with General Monk	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1674
and so offer things to the King so high on the Presbyterian account that he may refuse	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1674
and so they will endeavour some more mischief.	O O O O O O O O	fear	1674
Which story is very strange that he should lose his reputation of being a man of courage now at one blow for that he was not able to fight one stroke	O O O B-EMO I-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1675
but desired of Colonel Igoldsby several times to let him escape.	O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1675
I went with Captain Hayward 'to the Plymouth and Essex	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1676
and did what I had to do and returned	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1676
where very merry at dinner After dinner	O B-EMO I-EMO O O O O	happiness	1676
to the rest of the ships quite through the fleet Which was a very brave sight to visit all the ships	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1676
and to be received with the respect and honour that I was on board them all.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1676
I returned to the Nazeby	O O O O O	happiness	1677
where my Lord was much pleased to hear how all the fleet took it in a transport of joy	O O O O B-EMO I-EMO O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1677

and another from the Duke of York in such familiar style as their common friend	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1677
with all kindness imaginable	O O O O	happiness	1677
After Cromwell had put down the House Of Peers	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1678
he was chosen a Member of the House of Commons	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1678

a stranger preached here for Mr	O O O O O O	happiness	1680

one Mr	O O	happiness	1680

who prayed for King Charles	O O O O O	happiness	1680
by the Grace of God	O O O O O	happiness	1680

which gave great contentment to the gentlemen that were on board here	O O B-EMO I-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1680
and they said they would talk of it	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1680
when they come to Breda	O O O O O	happiness	1680
as not having it done yet in London so publickly.	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1680
In the afternoon my Lord and I walked together in the coach two hours	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1681
talking together upon all sorts of discourse: as religion	O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1681
wherein he is	O O O	disgust	1681
I perceive	O O	disgust	1681
wholly sceptical	B-EMO I-EMO	disgust	1681
saying	O	disgust	1681
that indeed the Protestants as to the Church of Rome are wholly fanatiques.	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	1681
Without making any stay at Dover The shouting and joy expressed by all is past imagination seeing that my Lord did not stir out of his barge	O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1682
I got into a boat and so into his barge My Lord almost transported with joy that he had done all this without any the least blur or obstruction in the world.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1682
Being with my Lord in the morning about business in his cabbin	O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1683
I took occasion to give him thanks for his love to me in the share that he had given me of his Majesty's money	O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1683
and the Duke's.	O O O	happiness	1683
It was strange to see how all the people flocked together bare	O O B-EMO O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1684
to see the King looking out of the Council window	O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1684
At night my Lord told me how my orders that I drew last night about giving us power to act	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1684
are granted by the Council.	O O O O O	surprise	1684
This morning my brother Tom brought me my jackanapes coat with silver buttons	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1685
It rained this morning	O O O O	fear	1685
which	O	fear	1685
makes us fear that the glory of this day will be lost	O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1685
the King and Parliament being to be entertained by the City to-day with great pomp.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1685
My Lord and I upon our knees together took our oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1686
and the Oath of the Privy Seale	O O O O O O O	fear	1686
of which I was much glad	O O O O O O	fear	1686
though I am not likely to get anything by it at present	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1686
but I do desire it	O O O O O	fear	1686
for fear of a turn-out of our office.	O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1686
An Oxford man	O O O	anger	1687
who spoke very much against the height of the now old clergy	O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1687
for putting out many of the religious fellows of Colleges	O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1687
and inveighing against them for their being drunk	O B-EMO O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	1687
It being post-night	O O O	anger	1687
I wrote to my Lord to give him notice that all things are well.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1687
I was much troubled	O O O O	fear	1688
for fear of being forced to pay the money myself	O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1688
Called at my father's going home	O O O O O O	fear	1688
and bespoke mourning for myself	O O B-EMO O O	fear	1688
for the death of the Duke of Gloucester.	O O O O O O O O	fear	1688
He seemed to be in a melancholy humour	O O O O O O O O	fear	1689
which	O	fear	1689
I was told by W	O O O O O	fear	1689
Howe	O	fear	1689
was for that he had lately lost a great deal of money at cards	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1689
which he fears he do too much addict himself to now-a-days.	O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1689
Chetwind told me that he did fear that this late business of the Duke of York's would prove fatal to my Lord Chancellor	O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1690
To our office	O O O	fear	1690
where we met all	O O O O	fear	1690
for the sale of two ships by an inch of candle (the first time that ever I saw any of this kind)	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1690
where I observed how they do invite one another	O O O O O O O O O	fear	1690
and at last how they all do cry	O O O O O O O O	fear	1690
and we have much to do to tell who did cry last.	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1690
I went with the Treasurer in his coach to White Hall	O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1691
and in our way	O O O O	anger	1691
in discourse	O O	anger	1691
do find him a very good-natured man	O O O O O O O	anger	1691
and	O	anger	1691
talking of those men who now stand condemned for murdering the King	O O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	1691
he says that he believes	O O O O O	anger	1691
that	O	anger	1691
if the law would give leave	O O O O O O	anger	1691
the King is a man of so great compassion that he would wholly acquit them.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1691
In the afternoon I went to White Hall	O O O O O O O O	surprise	1692
where I was surprised with the news of a plot against the King's person and my Lord Monk's	O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1692
and that since last night there were about forty taken up on suspicion.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1692
After dinner Mr	O O O	fear	1693
Shepley and I in private talking about my Lord's intentions to go speedily into the country	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1693
but to what end we know not	O O O O O O O	fear	1693
We fear he is to go to sea	O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1693
with his fleet now preparing	O O O O O	fear	1693
But we wish that he could get his 4000l.	O O O O O O O O O	fear	1693
Then in the Quire at the high altar	O O O O O O O O	sadness	1694
the King passed through all the ceremonies of the Coronation	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1694
which to my great grief I and most in the Abbey could not see The crowne being put upon his head	O O O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1694
a great shout begun	O O O O	sadness	1694
and he come forth to the throne	O O O O O O O	sadness	1694
and there passed through more ceremonies.	O O O O O O	sadness	1694
Though he gives me nothing at present till my father's death	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1695
or at least very little	O O O O O	happiness	1695
yet I am glad to see that he hath done so well for us all	O O O B-EMO O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1695
and well to the rest of his kindred.	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1695
So that I was afraid the other would have too great a conquest over them Then to the Wardrobe	O O O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1696
and dined there	O O O	fear	1696
and then abroad and in Cheapside hear that the Spanish hath got the best of it	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1696
and killed three of the French coach-horses and severall men	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1696
and is gone through the City next to our King's coach.	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1696
When it comes the next month to sit again	O O O O O O O O O	fear	1697
would bring trouble with it	O O O O O	fear	1697
and enquire how the King had disposed of offices and money	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1697
before they will raise more	O O O O O	fear	1697
which	O	fear	1697
I fear	O B-EMO	fear	1697
will bring all things to ruin again	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1697
Dined with Captain Lambert and his father-in-law	O O O O O O O	fear	1697
and had much talk of Portugall.	O O O O O O	fear	1697
The greatest pains were afterwards taken to preserve the fortress	O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1698
and a fine Mole was constructed	O O O O O O	sadness	1698
at a vast expense	O O O O	sadness	1698
to improve the harbour.	O O O O	sadness	1698
At length	O O	disgust	1699
after immense sums of money had been wasted there	O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1699
the House of Commons expressed a dislike to the management of the garrison	O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	1699
which they suspected to be a nursery for a Popish army	O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1699
and seemed disinclined to maintain it any longer.	O O O O O O O O	disgust	1699
I am much troubled for it	O O B-EMO I-EMO O O	disgust	1700
and for the grief and disgrace it brings to their familys and friends.	O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	1700
But I do not see much true joy	O O O O O O O O	sadness	1701
but only an indifferent one	O O O O O	sadness	1701
in the hearts of the people	O O O O O O	sadness	1701
who are much discontented at the pride and luxury of the Court	O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1701
and running in debt.	O O O O	sadness	1701
And that the King is pleased enough with her: which	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1702

The Court is wholly now at Hampton	O O O O O O O	fear	1702
A peace with Argier is lately made.	O O O O O O O	fear	1702
My Lord Peterborough is come unexpected from Tangier	O O O O O O O O	fear	1703

By water to White Hall	O O O O O	happiness	1704

The spoilers see and quake	O O O O O	fear	1705

No more Cared they for deeds of men	O O O O O O O O	sadness	1707

Scared were the Argives	O O O O	fear	1708

Lest haply the recoiling ploughshare light On their leg-sinews.	O O O O O O O O O	anger	1709
Then Aphrodite	O O	sadness	1710

snatched suddenly away Renowned Aeneas from the deadly strife	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1710

Fate forbade That hero any longer to contend With Argive foes without the high-built wall	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1711

and his mother sorely feared the wrath Of Pallas passing-wise	O O O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1711

No more the Trojans now abode the edge Of fight	O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1713

In hope to lay that stately fortress low.	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1720

slinking past the men And dogs that watch	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1721
all keen to ward the sheep.	O O O O O O	happiness	1721
So without sound of voices marched they on Unto the Trojans' fortress	O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1722
eager all To help those mighty chiefs with foes begirt.	B-EMO O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1722

impaling them Where sharpest stings the anguish-laden steelAnd all about the city dolorous howls Of dogs uprose	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1723

For the first quarter of an hour	O O O O O O O	sadness	1727

if was not steering	O O O O	sadness	1727
it was sculling	O O O	sadness	1727
the old bumboat was wobbling all around like a drunken tailor with two left legs	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1727
I fairly shook with apprehension lest the mate should come and look in the compass	O O O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1727
I had been accustomed to hard words if I did not steer within half a point each way.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1727
The third mate was nothing much but bad temper--not much sailor	O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1729

but--for the time--I felt glad I was not on board of her	O O O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1730
a very few minutes she was out of our ken	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1730
followed by the admiration of all.	O O O O O O	happiness	1730
We were all gathered about the fo'lk'sle scuttle one evening	O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1731
a few days after the gale referred to in the previous chapter	O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1731
and the question of whale-fishing came up for discussion	O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1731
Until that time	O O O	surprise	1731
strange as it may seem	B-EMO O O O O	surprise	1731
no word of this	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1731
the central idea of all our minds	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1731
had been mooted	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1731
ery man seemed to shun the subject	O O O O O O O	surprise	1731
although we were in daily expectation of being called upon to take an active part in whale-fighting.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1731
So we toiled watch and watch	O O O O O O	fear	1732
six hours on and six off	O O O O O O	fear	1732
the work never ceasing for an instant night or day Though the work was hard and dirty	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1732
and the discomfort of being so continually wet through with oil great	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1732
there was only one thing dangerous about the whole business That was the job of filling and shifting the huge casks of oil	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1732
Some of these were of enormous size	O O O O O O O	fear	1732
containing 350 gallons when full	O O O O O	fear	1732
and the work of moving them about the greasy deck of a rolling ship was attended with a terrible amount of risk.	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O B-EMO O O O	fear	1732
However	O	sadness	1733
the fact that the theft was discovered soon became painfully evident	O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O	sadness	1733
for we had a visit from the afterguard in force one afternoon	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1733
and Abner with his brewage was haled to the quarter-deck	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1733
There	O	sadness	1733
in the presence of all hands	O O O O O O	sadness	1733
he was arraigned	O O O	sadness	1733
found guilty of stealing the ship's stores	O O O O O O O	sadness	1733
and sentence passed upon him.	O O O O O	sadness	1733
Suddenly one of the men	O O O O O	happiness	1734
in lifting his net	O O O O	happiness	1734
slipped on the smooth bottom of the boat	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1734
jolting one of the oars	O O O O O	happiness	1734
There was a gleam of light below as the school turned--they had all disappeared instanter	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1734
We had been so busy that we had not noticed the dimensions of our catch	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1734
but now	O O	happiness	1734
to our great joy	O O B-EMO I-EMO	happiness	1734
we found that we had at least eight hundred fish nearly as large as herrings	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1734
We at once returned to the ship	O O O O O O O	happiness	1734
having been absent only two hours	O O O O O O	happiness	1734
during which we had caught sufficient to provide all hands with three good meals.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1734
Now	O	fear	1736
with us	O O	fear	1736
whenever the weather was doubtful or squally-looking	O O O O O O O	fear	1736
we shortened sail	O O O	fear	1736
and kept it fast till better weather came along	O O O O O O O O O	fear	1736
being quite careless whether we made one mile a day or one hundred	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1736
But just because nobody took any notice of our progress as the days passed	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1736
we were occasionally startled to find how far we had really got	O O O B-EMO O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1736
This was certainly the case with all of us forward	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1736
even to me who had some experience	O O O O O O O	fear	1736
so well used had I now become to the leisurely way of getting along.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1736
There were men in that forecastle as good citizens and as brave fellows as you would wish to meet--men who in their own sphere would have commanded and obtained respect	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1737
But under the painful and abnormal circumstances in which they found themselves--beaten and driven like dogs while in the throes of sea-sickness	O O O B-EMO O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1737
Half starved and hopeless	O O O O	sadness	1737
their spirit had been so broken	O O O O O O	sadness	1737
and they were so kept down to that sad level by the display of force	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1737
aided by deadly weapons aft	O O O O O	sadness	1737
that no other condition could be expected for them but that of broken-hearted slaves.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1737
We saw none	O O O	surprise	1738
however	O	surprise	1738
and at daylight we weighed and towed the ship out to sea with the boats	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1738
there being no wind	O O O O	surprise	1738
While busy at this uninteresting pastime	O O O O O O	surprise	1738
one of the boats slipped away	O O O O O O	surprise	1738
returning presently with a fine turtle	O O O O O O	surprise	1738
which they had surprised during his morning's nap	O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1738
e of the amphibious Portuguese slipped over the boat's side as she neared the sleeping SPHARGA	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1738
and	O	surprise	1738
diving deep	O O	surprise	1738
came up underneath him.	O O O O	surprise	1738
Down comes the black watcher from above with a swoop like an eagle	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1739
Booby puts all she knows into her flight	O O O O O O O O	sadness	1739
but vainly	O O	sadness	1739
Escape is impossible	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1739
so with a despairing shriek she drops her load.	O O O B-EMO O O O O O	sadness	1739
When we got on board we felt quite happy	O O O O O O O O B-EMO	happiness	1740
and	O	happiness	1740
for the first time since leaving America	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1740
we had a little singing	O O O O O	happiness	1740
all I be laughed at when I confess that our musical efforts were confined to Sankey's hymns	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1740
but as we secured five of them	O O O O O O O	happiness	1741
averaging seven barrels each	O O O O	happiness	1741
with scarcely any trouble	O O O O	happiness	1741
I felt quite pleased with myself	O O O O O O	happiness	1741
We had quite an exciting bit of sport with them	O O O O B-EMO O O O O O	happiness	1741
they were so lively.	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1741
The chief anxiety was for the safety of the boats	O O B-EMO O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1742
t as for danger--well	O O O O	fear	1742
"they only seemed like big ""black fish"" to us now"	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1742
and we quite enjoyed the fun.	O O O O O O	fear	1742
nor would any sane man falling across them run the risk of closer examination into details than we had done	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1743
It was a great pity that we were not able to sink the prahu with her ghastly cargo	O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1743
and so free the air from that poisonous foetor that was a deadly danger to any vessel getting under her lee	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1743
Next day	O O	sadness	1743
and for a whole week after	O O O O O O	sadness	1743
we had a stark calm such a calm as one realizes who reads sympathetically that magical piece of work	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1743
"the ""Ancient Mariner."""	O O O	sadness	1743
PLike some gigantic beacon	O O O O	happiness	1745
the enormous mass of the Golden Mountain dominated the peaceful scene	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1745
ulo Way	O O	happiness	1745
or Water Island	O O O	happiness	1745
looked very inviting	O O O	happiness	1745

but so little known by actual touching at	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1745
Our recent stay at the Cocos	O O O O O O	happiness	1745
however	O	happiness	1745
had settled the question of our calling anywhere else for some time decidedly in the negative	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1745
unless we might be compelled by accident	O O O O O O O	happiness	1745
Thinking that such a sight ought not to be missed by the captain	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1746
I overcame my dread of him sufficiently to call him	O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1746
and tell him of what was taking place	O O O O O O O O	anger	1746
He met my remarks with such a furious burst of anger at my daring to disturb him for such a cause	O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	1746
that I fled precipitately on deck again	O O O O O O O	anger	1746
having the remainder of the vision to myself	O O O O O O O O	anger	1746
for none of the others cared sufficiently for such things to lose five minutes' sleep in witnessing them	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1746
The conflict ceased	O O O	anger	1746
the sea resumed its placid calm	O O O O O O	anger	1746
and nothing remained to tell of the fight but a strong odour of fish	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1746
as of a bank of seaweed left by the tide in the blazing sun.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1746
Since leaving port we had not felt so comfortable	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1748
the work	O O	sadness	1748
with all its disagreeables	O O O O	sadness	1748
seeming as nothing now that we could do it without fear and trembling	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1748
Alas for poor Jemmy	O O B-EMO O	sadness	1748
--as we always persisted in calling him from inability to pronounce his proper name--his case was evidently hopeless	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1748
His fellows did their poor best to comfort his fast-fleeting hours	O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1748
one after another murmuring to him the prayers of the Church.	O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1748
Once clear of the southern end of Formosa we had quite a rapid run to the Bonins	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1749
carrying a press of sail day and night	O O O O O O O O	fear	1749
as the skipper was anxious to arrive there on account of his recent injuries	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1749
He was still very lame	O O O O O	fear	1749
and he feared that some damage might have been done to him of which he was ignorant	O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1749
Besides	O	fear	1749
it was easy to see that he did not altogether like anybody else being in charge of his ship	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1749
no matter how good they were.	O O O O O O	fear	1749
The chief was looking astern at some finbacks	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1750
the look-out men forward were both staring to leeward	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1750
thus for a minute or so I had a small arc of the horizon to myself	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1750
The time was short	O O O O	happiness	1750
but it sufficed	O O O	happiness	1750

Count	O	happiness	1751
seeing how matters were going	O O O O O	happiness	1751
had hastily patched his boat	O O O O O	happiness	1751
returning at once with another tub of line	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1751
He was but just in time to bend on	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1751

This in no wise terminated his lien on the whale	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1751
supposing he could prove that he struck first	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1751
but it got him out of the way for the time.	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1751
Consequently the state of the ship was filthy	O O O O O O O O	anger	1752
nor could all our efforts keep her clean	O O O O O O O O	anger	1752
This farmyard condition of things was permitted to continue for about a week	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1752
when the officers got so tired of it	O O O O O O O O	anger	1752

lay the calipee	O O O	anger	1753
or under- shell of the turtle	O O O O O O	anger	1753
hacked into irregular blocks.	O O O O	anger	1753
But he gradually returned to his old self	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1754
to my great relief	O O O B-EMO	happiness	1754
and I ventured somewhat timidly to remind him of the esteem in which he was held by all hands	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1754
even the skipper	O O O	happiness	1754
I ventured to say	O O O O	happiness	1754
respected him	O O	happiness	1754
although	O	happiness	1754
from some detestable form of ill- humour	O O O O O O O	happiness	1754
he had chosen to be so sneering and insulting towards him.	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1754
As far as I could judge	O O O O O O	happiness	1755
they were the happiest of people	O O O B-EMO O O	happiness	1755
literally taking no thought for the morrow and content with the barest necessaries of life	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1755
so long as they were free and the sun shone brightly	O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1755
We had many opportunities of cultivating their acquaintance	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1755
for the captain allowed us much liberty	O O O O O O O	happiness	1755
quite one- half of the crew and officers being ashore most of the time.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1755
I felt sure	O O O	fear	1757
however	O	fear	1757
that we should have but little more trouble with our fish	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1757
In fact	O O	fear	1757
I was half afraid that he would die before getting to the surface	O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1757
in which case he might sink and be lost	O O O O O O O O O	fear	1757
We hauled steadily away	O O O O	fear	1757
the line not coming in very easily	O O O O O O O	fear	1757
until I judged there was only about another hundred fathoms out.	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1757
The fine haul we had obtained just previous to that day seemed to have exhausted our luck for the time being	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1758
for never a spout did we see	O O O O O O O	happiness	1758
And it was with no ordinary delight that we hailed the advent of an immense school of black-fish	O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1758
the first we had run across for a long time	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1758
Determined to have a big catch	O O O O O O	happiness	1758
if possible	O O	happiness	1758
we lowered all five boats	O O O O O	happiness	1758
as it was a beautifully calm day	O O O O O O O	happiness	1758
and the ship might almost safely have been left to look after herself.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1758
The accident was the fruit of gross carelessness	O O O O O O O O	surprise	1759
and should never have occurred	O O O O O	surprise	1759
But then	O O	surprise	1759
strange to say	B-EMO O O	surprise	1759
disasters to whale-boats are nearly always due to want of care	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1759
the percentage of unavoidable casualties being very small as compared with those like the one just related	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1759
When the highly dangerous nature of the work is remembered	O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1759
this statement may seem somewhat overdrawn	O O O O O O	surprise	1759
At that last titanic effort of his he had rushed downward with such terrific force that	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1760
striking his head on the bottom	O O O O O O	sadness	1760
he had broken his neck	O O O O O	sadness	1760
I felt very grieved that we had lost the chance of securing him	O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1760
but it was perfectly certain that before we could get help to raise him	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1760
all that would be left of his skeleton would be quite valueless to us	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1760
So with such patience as we could command we waited near the entrance until the receding ebb made it possible for us to emerge once more into the blessed light of day.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1760
Let it be so	O O O O	happiness	1761
For my part	O O O	happiness	1761
I rejoice that I have no tale of weeks of drunkenness	O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1761
of brutal rape	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1761
treacherous murder	B-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1761
and almost unthinkable torture to tell.	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1761
Why are good folks ashore systematically misled into the belief that the sailor is an object of charity	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1762
and that it is necessary to subscribe continually and liberally to provide him with food and shelter when ashore	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1762
"Most of the contributors would be surprised to know that the cost of board and lodging at the ""home"" is precisely the same as it is outside"	O O O O O O B-EMO O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1762
and much higher than a landsman of the same grade can live for in better style	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1762
With the exception of the sleeping accommodation	O O O O O O O	surprise	1762
most men prefer the boarding-house	O O O O O	surprise	1762
where	O	surprise	1762
"if they preserve the same commercial status which is a SINE QUA NON at the ""home"	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1762
""" they are treated like gentlemen"	O O O O O O	surprise	1762
While the final touch was being given to our task--i	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1763
the hole-boring through the tail-fin--all hands lay around in various picturesque attitudes	O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1763
enjoying a refreshing smoke	O O O O	sadness	1763
care forgetting	O O	sadness	1763
While thus pleasantly employed	O O O O	sadness	1763
sudden death	B-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1763
like a bolt from the blue	O O O O O O	sadness	1763
leapt into our midst in a terrible form	O O O O O O B-EMO O	sadness	1763
The skipper was labouring hard at his task of cutting the hole for the tow-line	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1763
when without warning the great fin swung back as if suddenly released from tremendous tension.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1763
A ruined house	O O O	surprise	1764
surrounded by other vestiges of what had once been a homestead	O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1764
stood in the middle of this piece of land	O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1764
Feeling curious to know what the history of this isolated settlement might be	O B-EMO O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1764
I asked the mate if he knew anything of it	O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1764
He told me that an American named Halstead	O O O O O O O O	surprise	1764
with his family	O O O	surprise	1764
lived here for years	O O O O	surprise	1764
visited only by an occasional whaler	O O O O O O	surprise	1764
to whom they sold such produce as they might have and be able to spare at the time.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1764
This was a novel experience for us in the CACHALOT	O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1765
and I was curious to see how she would behave	O O O B-EMO O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1765
To my mind	O O O	surprise	1765
"the supreme test of a ship's sea-kindliness is the length of time she will scud before a gale without ""pooping"" a sea"	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1765
or taking such heavy water on board over her sides as to do serious damage.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1765
Shall we take scorn instead of glory	O O O O O O O	surprise	1766
The Briton will marvel that he was conquered by men whom he sees fear is enough to conquer	O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1766
We struck them before with panic	O O O O O O	surprise	1766
shall we be panic-stricken by them	O O O O O O	surprise	1766
We scorned them when before us	O O O O O O	surprise	1766
Nothing of advantage to our cargo was seen for a long time	O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1767
which	O	surprise	1767
although apparently what was to be expected	O O O O O O O	surprise	1767
did not improve Captain Slocum's temper	O O O O O O	surprise	1767
But	O	surprise	1767
to the surprise of all	O O B-EMO O O	surprise	1767
when we had arrived off the beautiful island of Hong Kong	O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1767
to which we approached closely	O O O O O	surprise	1767
"we ""raised"" a grand sperm whale."	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1767
When morning dawned we hove-to	O O O O O	happiness	1769
the land being only dimly visible astern	O O O O O O O	happiness	1769
"and finished taking on board our ""head matter"" without further incident"	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1769
The danger past	O O O	happiness	1769
we were all well pleased that the captain was below	O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1769
for the work proceeded quite pleasantly under the genial rule of the mate	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1769
Since leaving port we had not felt so comfortable	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1769
the work	O O	happiness	1769
with all its disagreeables	O O O O	happiness	1769
seeming as nothing now that we could do it without fear and trembling.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1769
True	O	surprise	1770
the man was but a unit of no special note among us	O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1770
but death had conferred upon him a brevet rank	O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1770
in virtue of which be dominated every thought	O O O O O O O O	surprise	1770
It seemed strange to me that we who faced death so often and variously	O O B-EMO O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1770
until natural fear had become deadened by custom	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1770
should	O	surprise	1770
now that one of our number lay a rapidly-corrupting husk before us	O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1770
be so tremendously impressed by the simple	O O O O O O O	surprise	1770
inevitable fact.	O O	surprise	1770
None of your high art here	O O O O O O	surprise	1771
but haul in hand over hand	O O O O O O	surprise	1771
the line being strong enough to land a 250 pound fish	O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1771
Up he came	O O O	surprise	1771
the beauty	O O	surprise	1771
all silver and scarlet and blue	O O O O O O	surprise	1771
five feet long if an inch	O O O O O O	surprise	1771
and weighing 35 pounds	O O O O	surprise	1771
Well	O	surprise	1771
such a lot of astonished men I never saw	O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1771
They could hardly believe their eyes	O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO	surprise	1771
That such a daring innovation should be successful was hardly to be believed	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O	surprise	1771
even with the vigorous evidence before them	O O O O O O O	surprise	1771
Even grim Captain Slocum came to look and turned upon me as I thought a less lowering brow than usual	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1771
while Mr	O O	surprise	1771
Count	O	surprise	1771
the mate	O O	surprise	1771
fairly chuckled again at the thought of how the little Britisher had wiped the eyes of these veteran fishermen.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1771
How did a whale act	O O O O O	disgust	1772
what were the first steps taken	O O O O O O	disgust	1772
what chance was there of being saved if your boat got smashed	O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1772
and so on unto infinity	O O O O O	disgust	1772
At last	O O	disgust	1772
"getting very tired of this ""Portugee Parliament"" of all talkers and no listeners"	O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	1772
I went aft to get a drink of water before turning in	O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1772
The harpooners and other petty officers were grouped in the waist	O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1772
earnestly discussing the pros and cons of attack upon whales.	O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1772
I said as cheerfully as I could	O O O O O O O	fear	1773
"""All right"	O O	fear	1773
sir	O	fear	1773
""" trying to look unconcerned"	O O O O O	fear	1773
telling myself not to be a coward	O O O O O O O	fear	1773
and all sorts of things	O O O O O	fear	1773
but the cold truth is that I was scared almost to death because I didn't know what was comingHowever	O O O O O O O O B-EMO O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1773
I did the best thing under the circumstances	O O O O O O O O	fear	1773
obeyed orders and looked steadily astern	O O O O O O	fear	1773
or up into the bronzed impassive face of my chief	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1773
who towered above me	O O O O	fear	1773
scanning with eagle eyes the sea ahead.	O O O O O O O	fear	1773
He raised a gigantic tail on high	O O O O O O O	anger	1774
threshing the water with deafening blows	O O O O O O	anger	1774
rolling at the same time from side to side until the surrounding sea was white with froth	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1774
I felt in an agony lest we should be crushed under one of those fearful strokes	O O O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	1774
for Mr	O O	anger	1774
Count appeared to be oblivious of possible danger	O O O O O O O O	anger	1774
although we seemed to be now drifting back on to the writhing leviathan	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1774
In the agitated condition of the sea	O O O O O O O	anger	1774
it was a task of no ordinary difficulty to unship the tall mast	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1774
which was of course the first thing to be done.	O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1774
So we toiled watch and watch	O O O O O O	fear	1775
six hours on and six off	O O O O O O	fear	1775
the work never ceasing for an instant night or day Though the work was hard and dirty	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1775
and the discomfort of being so continually wet through with oil great	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1775
there was only one thing dangerous about the whole business	O O O O O B-EMO O O O O	fear	1775
That was the job of filling and shifting the huge casks of oil	O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1775
Some of these were of enormous size	O O O O O O O	fear	1775
containing 350 gallons when full	O O O O O	fear	1775
and the work of moving them about the greasy deck of a rolling ship was attended with a terrible amount of risk.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1775
It will not	O O O	fear	1776
of course	O O	fear	1776
have escaped the reader's notice that I have not hitherto attempted to give any details concerning the structure of the whale just dealt with	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1776
The omission is intentional	O O O O	fear	1776
During this	O O	fear	1776
our first attempt at real whaling	O O O O O O	fear	1776
my mind was far too disturbed by the novelty and danger of the position in which I found myself for the first time	O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O O	fear	1776
for me to pay any intelligent attention to the party of the second part.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1776
We had been so busy that we had not noticed the dimensions of our catch	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1777
but now	O O	happiness	1777
to our great joy	O O B-EMO I-EMO	happiness	1777
we found that we had at least eight hundred fish nearly as large as herrings	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1777
We at once returned to the ship	O O O O O O O	happiness	1777
having been absent only two hours	O O O O O O	happiness	1777
during which we had caught sufficient to provide all hands with three good meals.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1777
He made a fearful to-do over it	O O O O O O O	happiness	1779
rolling completely over several times backward and forward	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1779
at the same time smiting the sea with his mighty tail	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1779
making an almost deafening noise and pother	O O O O O O O	happiness	1779
But we were comfortable enough	O O O B-EMO O	happiness	1779
while we unshipped the mast and made ready for action	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1779
being sufficiently far away from him to escape the full effect of his gambols.	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1779
During the conflict I had not noticed what now claimed attention-- several great masses of white	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1780
semi-transparent-looking substance floating about	O O O O	surprise	1780
of huge size and irregular shape	O O O O O O	surprise	1780
But one of these curious lumps came floating by as we lay	O O O O B-EMO O O O O O O O	surprise	1780
tugged at by several fish	O O O O O	surprise	1780
and I immediately asked the mate if he could tell me what it was and where it came from	O O O O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1780
He told me that	O O O O	surprise	1780
when dying	O O	surprise	1780
the cachalot always ejected the contents of his stomach	O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1780
which were invariably composed of such masses as we saw before us	O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1780
that he believed the stuff to be portions of big cuttle-fish	O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1780
bitten off by the whale for the purpose of swallowing	O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1780
but he wasn't sure	O O O O	surprise	1780
Anyhow	O	surprise	1780
I could haul this piece alongside now	O O O O O O O	surprise	1780
if I liked	O O O	surprise	1780
and see.	O O	surprise	1780
Anyhow	O	surprise	1781
I could haul this piece alongside now	O O O O O O O	surprise	1781
if I liked	O O O	surprise	1781
and see	O O	surprise	1781
Secretly wondering at the indifference shown by this officer of forty years' whaling experience to such a wonderful fact as appeared to be here presented	O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1781
I thanked him	O O O	surprise	1781
and	O	surprise	1781
sticking the boat-hook into the lump	O O O O O O	surprise	1781
drew it alongside.	O O O	surprise	1781
At seven bells (7	O O O O	disgust	1782
") it was ""turn to"" all hands again"	O O O O O O O O	disgust	1782
"The ""junk "" was hooked on to both cutting tackles"	O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1782
and the windlass manned by everybody who could get hold	O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1782
Slowly the enormous mass rose	O O O O O	disgust	1782
canting the ship heavily as it came	O O O O O O O	disgust	1782
while every stick and rope aloft complained of the great strain upon them	O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	1782
When at last it was safely shipped	O O O O O O O	disgust	1782
and the tackles cast off	O O O O O	disgust	1782
the size of this small portion of a full-grown cachalot's body could be realized	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1782
not before.	O O	disgust	1782
Here	O	disgust	1783
however	O	disgust	1783
we were better off than in an ordinary merchantman	O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1783
where doldrums are enough to drive you mad	O B-CAU O O O O O B-EMO	disgust	1783
The one object being to get along	O O O O O O O	disgust	1783
"it is incessant ""pully- hauly"	O O O O O	disgust	1783
""" setting and taking in sail"	O O O O O O	disgust	1783
in order	O O	disgust	1783
on the one hand	O O O O	disgust	1783
to lose no time	O O O O	disgust	1783
and	O	disgust	1783
on the other	O O O	disgust	1783
to lose no sails.	O O O O	disgust	1783
Now	O	fear	1784
with us	O O	fear	1784
whenever the weather was doubtful or squally-looking	O O O O O O O	fear	1784
we shortened sail	O O O	fear	1784
and kept it fast till better weather came along	O O O O O O O O O	fear	1784
being quite careless whether we made one mile a day or one hundred	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1784
But just because nobody took any notice of our progress as the days passed	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1784
we were occasionally startled to find how far we had really got	O O O B-EMO O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1784
This was certainly the case with all of us forward	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1784
even to me who had some experience	O O O O O O O	fear	1784
so well used had I now become to the leisurely way of getting along.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1784
With hearty cheers from the whole population	O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1785
we shoved off and ploughed through the kelp seaweed again	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1785
When we got clear of it	O O O O O O	happiness	1785
we found the swell heavier than when we had come	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1785
and a rough journey back to the ship was the result.	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1785
The men were afraid to go on to the sick-list	O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1786
Nothing short of total inability to continue would have prevented them from working	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1786
such was the terror with which that man had inspired us all	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1786
It may be said that we were a pack of cowards	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1786
who	O	fear	1786
without the courage to demand better treatment	O O O O O O O	fear	1786
deserved all we got.	O O O O	fear	1786
But under the painful and abnormal circumstances in which they found themselves--beaten and driven like dogs while in the throes of sea-sickness	O O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1787
half starved and hopeless	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1787
their spirit had been so broken	O O O O O B-EMO	sadness	1787
and they were so kept down to that sad level by the display of force	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1787
aided by deadly weapons aft	O O O O O	sadness	1787
that no other condition could be expected for them but that of broken-hearted slaves	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1787
My own case was many degrees better than that of the other whites	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1787
as I have before noted	O O O O O	sadness	1787
My own case was many degrees better than that of the other whites	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1788
as I have before noted	O O O O O	disgust	1788
but I was perfectly well aware that the slightest attempt on my part to show that I resented our common treatment would meet with the most brutal repression	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	1788
and	O	disgust	1788
in addition	O O	disgust	1788
I might look for a dreadful time of it for the rest of the voyage.	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	1788
The share of profits was so small	O O O O O O O	sadness	1789
and the time taken to earn it so long	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1789
such a number of clothes were worn out and destroyed by us	O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1789
only to be replaced from the ship's slop-chest at high prices	O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1789
that I had quite resigned myself to the prospect of leaving the vessel in debt	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1789
whenever that desirable event might happen	O O O O O O	sadness	1789
Since	O	sadness	1789
therefore	O	sadness	1789
I had never made it a practice to repine at the inevitable	O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1789
and make myself unhappy by the contemplation of misfortunes I was powerless to prevent	O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O	sadness	1789
I tried to interest myself as far as was possible in gathering information	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1789
although at that time I had no idea	O O O O O O O O	sadness	1789
beyond a general thirst for knowledge	O O O O O O	sadness	1789
that what I was now learning would ever he of any service to me.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1789
The weather of the Mozambique Channel was fairly good	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1791
although subject to electric storms of the most terrible aspect	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O B-EMO O	sadness	1791
but perfectly harmless	O O O	sadness	1791
On the second evening after rounding Cape St	O O O O O O O O	sadness	1791
Mary	O	sadness	1791
we were proceeding	O O O	sadness	1791
as usual	O O	sadness	1791
under very scanty sail	O O O O	sadness	1791
rather enjoying the mild	O O O O	sadness	1791
balmy air	O O	sadness	1791
scent-laden	O	sadness	1791
from Madagascar.	O O	sadness	1791
There was no thunder	O O O O	sadness	1792
but a low hissing and a crackling which did not amount to noise	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1792
although distinctly audible to all	O O O O O	sadness	1792
Sensations most unpleasant of pricking and general irritat were felt by every one	O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1792
according to their degree of susceptibility.	O O O O O O	sadness	1792
We saw none	O O O	surprise	1793
however	O	surprise	1793
and at daylight we weighed and towed the ship out to sea with the boats	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1793
there being no wind	O O O O	surprise	1793
While busy at this uninteresting pastime	O O O O O O	surprise	1793
one of the boats slipped away	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1793
returning presently with a fine turtle	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1793
which they had surprised during his morning's nap	O O O B-EMO O O O O	surprise	1793
One of the amphibious Portuguese slipped over the boat's side as she neared the sleeping SPHARGA	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1793
and	O	surprise	1793
diving deep	O O	surprise	1793
came up underneath him	O O O O	surprise	1793
seizing with crossed hands the two hind flippers.	O O O O O O O O	surprise	1793
Doubtless because he himself was much fatigued	O O O O O O O	happiness	1795
the mate allowed him to run at his will	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1795
without for the time attempting to haul any closer to him	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1795
and very grateful the short rest was to us	O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1795
But he had not gone a couple of miles before he turned a complete somersault in the water	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1795
coming up BEHIND us to rush off again in the opposite direction at undiminished speed.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1795
Up till now we had not succeeded in getting home a single lance	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1796
the foe was becoming warier	O O O O O	sadness	1796
while the strain was certainly telling upon our nerves	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1796
So Mr	O O	sadness	1796
Count got out his bomb-gun	O O O O O	sadness	1796
shouting at the same time to Mr	O O O O O O O	sadness	1796
Cruce to do the same	O O O O O	sadness	1796
They both hated these weapons	O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1796
nor ever used them if they could help it	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1796
but what was to be done	O O O O O O	sadness	1796
We got the whale cut in as usual without any incident worth mentioning	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1797
except that the peculiar shape of the jaw made it an object of great curiosity to all of us who were new to the whale- fishing	O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O B-EMO O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1797
Such malformations are not very rare	O O O O O O	surprise	1797
They are generally thought to occur when the animal is young	O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1797
and its bones soft	O O O O	surprise	1797
As soon as they had got far enough away from their native element	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1798
we rushed upon them	O O O O	happiness	1798
and captured them both	O O O O	happiness	1798
so that when the boat arrived we were not empty-handed	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1798
"We had also a ""jumper"	O O O O O	happiness	1798
""" or blouse"	O O O	happiness	1798
full of eggs	O O O	happiness	1798
and a couple of immense bunches of cocoa-nuts	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1798
When we got on board we felt quite happy	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O B-EMO	happiness	1798
and	O	happiness	1798
for the first time since leaving America	O O O O O O O	happiness	1798
we had a little singing	O O O O O	happiness	1798
Shall I be laughed at when I confess that our musical efforts were confined to Sankey's hymns	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1798
It was but a school of kogia	O O O O O O O	happiness	1799
"or ""short-headed"" cachalots"	O O O	happiness	1799
but as we secured five of them	O O O O O O O	happiness	1799
averaging seven barrels each	O O O O	happiness	1799
with scarcely any trouble	O O O O	happiness	1799
I felt quite pleased with myself	O O O O O O	happiness	1799
We had quite an exciting bit of sport with them	O O O O B-EMO O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1799
they were so lively	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1799
but as for danger--well	O O O O	happiness	1799
"they only seemed like big ""black fish"" to us now"	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1799
and we quite enjoyed the fun.	O O O O O O	happiness	1799
The chief anxiety was for the safety of the boats	O O B-EMO O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1800
Early on the second day of warning they had been hoisted to the topmost notch of the cranes	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1800
and secured as thoroughly as experience could suggest	O O O O O O O O	fear	1800
The terrible day wore on	O B-EMO O O O	sadness	1801
without any lightening of the tempest	O O O O O O	sadness	1801
till noon	O O	sadness	1801
when the wind suddenly fell to a calm	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1801
Until that time	O O O	sadness	1801
the sea	O O	sadness	1801
although heavy	O O	sadness	1801
was not vicious or irregular	O O O O O	sadness	1801
and we had not shipped any heavy water at all.	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1801
In two minutes we were speeding away towards her	O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1802
and	O	disgust	1802
making a sweep round her stern	O O O O O O	disgust	1802
prepared to board her	O O O O	disgust	1802
But we were met by a stench so awful that Mr	O O O O O O B-CAU O B-EMO O O	disgust	1802
Count would not proceed	O O O O	disgust	1802
and at once returned to the ship	O O O O O O O	disgust	1802
The boat was quickly hoisted again	O O O O O O	disgust	1802
and the ship manoeuvred to pass close to windward of the derelict.	O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1802
whatever it was	O O O	sadness	1804
it had been complete	O O O O	sadness	1804
nor would any sane man falling across them run the risk of closer examination into details than we had done	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1804
It was a great pity that we were not able to sink the prahu with her ghastly cargo	O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1804
and so free the air from that poisonous foetor that was a deadly danger to any vessel getting under her lee.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1804
Next day	O O	surprise	1805
and for a whole week after	O O O O O O	surprise	1805
we had a stark calm such a calm as one realizes who reads sympathetically that magical piece of work	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1805
"the ""Ancient Mariner"""	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1805
What an amazing instance of the triumph of the human imagination	O O B-EMO O O O O O O O O	surprise	1805
What an amazing instance of the triumph of the human imagination	O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1806
For Coleridge certainly never witnessed such a scene as he there describes with an accuracy of detail that is astounding	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O B-EMO	surprise	1806
Very few sailors have noticed the sickening condition of the ocean when the life-giving breeze totally fails for any length of time	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1806
or	O	surprise	1806
if they have	O O O	surprise	1806
they have said but little about it.	O O O O O O O	surprise	1806
A light breeze then sprang up	O O O O O O	happiness	1807
aided by which we crept around Achin Head	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1807
the northern point of the great island of Sumatra	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1807
Like some gigantic beacon	O O O O	happiness	1807
the enormous mass of the Golden Mountain dominated the peaceful scene	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1807
Pulo Way	O O	happiness	1807
or Water Island	O O O	happiness	1807
looked very inviting	O O O	happiness	1807
and I should have been glad to visit a place so well known to seamen by sight	O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1807
but so little known by actual touching at	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1807
Our recent stay at the Cocos	O O O O O O	happiness	1807
however	O	happiness	1807
had settled the question of our calling anywhere else for some time decidedly in the negative	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1807
unless we might be compelled by accident	O O O O O O O	happiness	1807
Therefore	O	sadness	1808
we had all a rough time of it while his angry fit lasted	O O O O B-EMO O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1808
which was a whole week	O O O O O	sadness	1808
or until all was shipshape again	O O O O O O	sadness	1808
Meanwhile we were edging gradually through the Malacca Straits and around the big island of Borneo	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1808
never going very near the land on account of the great and numerous dangers attendant upon coasting in those localities to any but those continually engaged in such a business.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1808
The sorely wounded monster	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1809
with one tremendous expiration	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1809
rolled over and over swift as thought towards his aggressor	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1809
literally burying the boat beneath his vast bulk	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1809
Now	O	surprise	1809
one would have thought surely	O O O O O	surprise	1809
upon seeing this	O O O	surprise	1809
that none of that boat's crew would ever have been seen again	O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1809
Nevertheless	O	surprise	1809
strange as it may appear	B-EMO O O O O	surprise	1809
out of that seething lather of foam	O O O O O O O	surprise	1809
all six heads emerged again in an instant	O O O O O O O O	surprise	1809
but on the OTHER side of the great creature.	O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1809
The truth of Mr	O O O O	sadness	1810
Count's forecast was verified to the hilt	O O O O O O O	sadness	1810
for we found that the captain was so badly bruised about	O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1810
the body that he was unable to move	O O O O O O O O	sadness	1810
while one of the hands	O O O O O	sadness	1810
a Portuguese	O O	sadness	1810
was injured internally	O O O	sadness	1810
and seemed very bad indeed	O O O O O	sadness	1810
Had any one told us that morning that we should be sorry to see Captain Slocum with sore bones	O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1810
we should have scoffed at the notion	O O O O O O O	sadness	1810
and some of us would probably have said that we should like to have the opportunity of making him smart.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1810
Once clear of the southern end of Formosa we had quite a rapid run to the Bonins	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1811
carrying a press of sail day and night	O O O O O O O O	fear	1811
as the skipper was anxious to arrive there on account of his recent injuries	O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1811
He was still very lame	O O O O O	fear	1811
and he feared that some damage might have been done to him of which he was ignorant.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1811
Once clear of the southern end of Formosa we had quite a rapid run to the Bonins	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1812
carrying a press of sail day and night	O O O O O O O O	fear	1812
as the skipper was anxious to arrive there on account of his recent injuries	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1812

Besides	O	fear	1812
it was easy to see that he did not altogether like anybody else being in charge of his ship	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1812
no matter how good they were.	O O O O O O	fear	1812
They were abusing him through all the varied gamut of filthy language they possessed	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1813
My democratic sentiments are deeply seated	O O O O O O	fear	1813
but I do believe in authority	O O O O O O	fear	1813
and respect for it being rigidly enforced	O O O O O O O	fear	1813
so this uncalled-for scene upset me	O O B-CAU I-CAU B-EMO O	fear	1813
making me feel anxious that the gibbering fools might get a lesson	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1813
They got one.	O O O	fear	1813
they were abusing him through all the varied gamut of filthy language they possessed	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1814

As I bent to my oar	O O O O O O	sadness	1815
I felt very sorry for what had happened	O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1815
Here were half the crew guilty of an act of violence upon an officer	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1815
which	O	sadness	1815
according to the severe code under which we lived	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1815
merited punishment as painful as could be inflicted	O O O O O O O O	sadness	1815
and lasting for the rest of the voyage.	O O O O O O O O	sadness	1815
This sort of thing was right in his line	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1817
Naturally cruel	O O	happiness	1817
he seemed to thoroughly enjoy himself in the prospect of making human beings twist and writhe in pain	O O O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1817
Nor would he be baulked of a jot of his pleasure.	O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO	happiness	1817
Not seeing what had happened to his iron	O O O O O O O O	fear	1819
or knowing that we were fast	O O O O O O	fear	1819
the other harpooner promptly hurled his second iron	O O O O O O O O	fear	1819
which struck solidly	O O O	fear	1819
It was a very pretty tangle	O O O O O O	fear	1819
but our position was rather bad	O B-CAU I-CAU O O B-EMO	fear	1819
The whale between us was tearing the bowels of the deep up in his rage and fear	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1819
we were struggling frantically to get our sail down	O O O O O O O O O	fear	1819
and at any moment that wretched iron through our upper strake might tear a plank out of us.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1819
It was a very pretty tangle	O O O O O O	anger	1820
but our position was rather bad	O B-CAU I-CAU O O O	anger	1820
The whale between us was tearing the bowels of the deep up in his rage and fear	O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O B-EMO O O	anger	1820
we were struggling frantically to get our sail down	O O O O O O O O O	anger	1820
and at any moment that wretched iron through our upper strake might tear a plank out of us.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1820
Our chief	O O	happiness	1821
foaming at the mouth with rage and excitement	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1821
was screeching inarticulate blasphemy at the other mate	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1821
who	O	happiness	1821
not knowing what was the matter	O O O O O O	happiness	1821
was yelling back all his copious vocabulary of abuse	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1821
I felt very glad the whale was between us	O O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1821
or there would surely have been murder done	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1821
At last	O O	happiness	1821
out drops the iron	O O O O	happiness	1821
leaving a jagged hole you could put your arm through	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1821
Wasn't Mr	O O	happiness	1821
Count mad	O O	happiness	1821
Wasn't Mr	O O	anger	1822
Count mad	O O	anger	1822
I really thought he would split with rage	O O O O O O O B-EMO	anger	1822
for it was impossible for us to go on with that hole in our bilge	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	1822
The second mate came alongside and took our line as the whale was just commencing to sound	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1822
thus setting us free.	O O O O	anger	1822
And still the whale kept going steadily down	O O O O O O O O	disgust	1823
down	O	disgust	1823
down	O	disgust	1823
Already he was on the second boat's lines	O O O O O O O O	disgust	1823
and taking them out faster than ever	O O O O O O O	disgust	1823
Had we been alone	O O O O	disgust	1823
this persistence on his part	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	1823
though annoying	O B-EMO	disgust	1823
would not have mattered much	O O O O O	disgust	1823
but	O	disgust	1823
with so many others in company	O O O O O O	disgust	1823
the possibilities of complication	O O O O	disgust	1823
should we need to slip our end	O O O O O O O	disgust	1823
were numerous.	O O	disgust	1823
When I recovered	O O O	happiness	1825
I was snug in my bunk aboard	O O O O O O O	happiness	1825
but aching in every joint	O O O O O	happiness	1825
and as sore as if I had been pounded with a club until I was bruised all over	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1825
During the day Mr	O O O O	happiness	1825
Count was kind enough to pay me a visit	O O B-EMO O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1825
With his usual luck	O O O O	happiness	1825
he had escaped without the slightest injury	O O O O O O O	happiness	1825
Consequently the state of the ship was filthy	O O O O O O O O	anger	1826
nor could all our efforts keep her clean	O O O O O O O O	anger	1826
This farmyard condition of things was permitted to continue for about a week	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1826
when the officers got so tired of it	O O O O O O O O	anger	1826
and the captain so annoyed at the frequent loss of fowls by their flying overboard	O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	1826
that the edict went forth to feed the foremast hands on poultry till further orders.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1826
When I told Samuela	O O O O	fear	1827
of his chance	O O O	fear	1827
he was beside himself with joy	O O O O O O	fear	1827
As to his being scared	O O O O B-EMO	fear	1827
the idea was manifestly absurd	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1827
He was as pleased with the prospect as it was possible for a man to be	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1827
and hardly able to contain himself for impatience to be off.	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1827
Two and a half hours of energetic work was required of us before we got on terms with the fleeing monsters	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1829
but at last	O O O	surprise	1829
to our great joy	O O O O	surprise	1829
they broke water from sounding right among us	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1829
It was a considerable surprise	O O O O B-EMO	surprise	1829
but we were all ready	O O O O O	surprise	1829
and before they had spouted twice	O O O O O O	surprise	1829
three boats were fast	O O O O	surprise	1829
only myself keeping out	O O O O	surprise	1829
in accordance with my instructions.	O O O O O	surprise	1829
It was a considerable surprise	O O O O O	disgust	1830
but we were all ready	O O O O O	disgust	1830
and before they had spouted twice	O O O O O O	disgust	1830
three boats were fast	O O O O	disgust	1830
only myself keeping out	O O O O	disgust	1830
in accordance with my instructions	O O O O O	disgust	1830
Samuela was almost distraught with rage and grief at the condition of things	O O O B-EMO O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	1830
I quite pitied him	O O O O	disgust	1830
although I was anything but pleased myself.	O O O O O O O	disgust	1830
Thenceforward for another hour	O O O O	disgust	1831
in spite of all our efforts	O O O O O O	disgust	1831
we could not get within striking distance	O O O O O O O	disgust	1831
mainly because of the close attention of the cow	O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1831
which stuck to her lord like a calf to its mother	O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1831
I was getting so impatient of this hindrance	O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU	disgust	1831
that it was all I could do to restrain myself from lancing the cow	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1831
though I felt convinced that	O O O O O	disgust	1831
if I did	O O O	disgust	1831
I should spoil a good job.	O O O O O O	disgust	1831
We took them on board	O O O O O	fear	1832
and the boat returned again	O O O O O	fear	1832
By the time the slack came we had about four hundred and fifty fathoms out--a goodly heap to pile up loose in our stern-sheets	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1832
I felt sure	O O O	fear	1832
however	O	fear	1832
that we should have but little more trouble with our fish	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1832
in fact	O O	fear	1832
I was half afraid that he would die before getting to the surface	O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1832
in which case he might sink and be lost	O O O O O O O O O	fear	1832
We hauled steadily away	O O O O	fear	1832
the line not coming in very easily	O O O O O O O	fear	1832
until I judged there was only about another hundred fathoms out.	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1832
The ceaseless motion of the vessel rocking at the centre of a circular space of blue	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1833
with a perfectly symmetrical dome of azure enclosing her above	O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1833
unflecked by a single cloud	O O O O O	anger	1833
becomes at last almost unbearable from its changeless sameness of environment	O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1833
Were it not for the trivial round and common task of everyday ship duty	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1833
some of the crew must become idiotic	O O O O O O O	anger	1833
or	O	anger	1833
in sheer rage at the want of interest in their lives	O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	1833
commit mutiny.	B-CAU I-CAU	anger	1833
The accident was the fruit of gross carelessness	O O O O O O O O	surprise	1835
and should never have occurred	O O O O O	surprise	1835
but then	O O	surprise	1835
strange to say	B-EMO O O	surprise	1835
disasters to whale-boats are nearly always due to want of care	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1835
the percentage of unavoidable casualties being very small as compared with those like the one just related.	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1835
for his first move was to come straight for me with a furious rush	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1836
carrying the war into the enemy's country with a vengeance It must be remembered that I was but young	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1836
and a comparatively new hand at this sort of thing	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1836
so when I confess that I felt more than a little scared at this sudden change in the tactics of my opponent	O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1836
I hope I shall be excusedRemembering	O O O O O O	fear	1836
however	O	fear	1836
that all our lives depended on keeping cool	O O O O O O O O	fear	1836
I told myself that even if I was frightened I must not go all to pieces	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1836
but compel myself to think and act calmly	O O O O O O O O	fear	1836
since I was responsible for others If the animal had not been in so blind a fury	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1836
I am afraid my task would have been much harder	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1836
so when I confess that I felt more than a little scared at this sudden change in the tactics of my opponent	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1837

I am afraid my task would have been much harder	O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1837
but he was mad	O O O O	fear	1837
and his savage rushes were	O O O O O	fear	1837
though disquieting	O O	fear	1837
unsystematic and clumsy.	O O O	fear	1837
I put my hand out to help myself to a sitting posture	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1839
and touched blubber	O B-CAU I-CAU	fear	1839
That startled me so that I sprung up as if shot	O B-EMO O O O O O O O O O	fear	1839
Then I took in the situation at a glance.	O O O O O O O O O	fear	1839
Samuela and Polly set to work with their sheath-knives	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1840
and soon excavated a space in the blubber to enable them to reach the meat	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1840
Then they cut off some good-sized junks	O O O O O O O	happiness	1840
and divided it up	O O O O	happiness	1840
It was not half bad	O O O O O	happiness	1840
and as we chewed on the tough black fibre	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1840
I could hardly help smiling as I thought how queer a Christmas dinner we were having	O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1840
But eating soon heightened our thirst	O O O O O O	happiness	1840
and our real sufferings then began.	O O O O O O	happiness	1840
The captain shook hands with me cordially	O O O O O O O	happiness	1841
pooh-poohing the loss of the boat as an unavoidable incident of the trade	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1841
but expressing his heart-felt delight at getting us all back safe	O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1841
The whale we had killed was ample compensation for the loss of several boats	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1841
though such was the vigour with which the sharks were going for him	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1841
that it was deemed advisable to cut in at once	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1841
working all night.	O O O	happiness	1841
We who had been rescued	O O O O O	sadness	1842
however	O	sadness	1842
were summarily ordered below by the skipper	O O O O O O O	sadness	1842
and forbidden	O O	sadness	1842
on pain of his severe displeasure	O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1842
to reappear until the following morning	O O O O O O	sadness	1842
This great privilege we gladly availed ourselves of	O O O O O O O O	sadness	1842
awaking at daylight quite well and fit	O O O O O O O	sadness	1842
not a bit the worse for our queer experience of the previous day.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1842
For unto us a Child is born	O O O O O O O	surprise	1843
"unto us a Son is given""--again and again--billows and billows of glory"	O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1843
I gasped for breath	O O O O	surprise	1843
shook like one in an ague fit	O O O O O O O	surprise	1843
the tears ran down in a continuous stream	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1843
while people stared amazed at me	O O O B-EMO O O	surprise	1843
thinking	O	surprise	1843
I suppose	O O	surprise	1843
that I was another drunken sailor.	O O O O O O	surprise	1843
I have no doubt whatever that some of the gentry who swear at large about the evils of missionaries would have been loud in their disgust at the entire absence of drink and debauchery	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	1844
and the prevalence of what they would doubtless characterize as adjective hypocrisy on the part of the natives	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	1844
but no decent man could help rejoicing at the peace	O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1844
the security	O O	disgust	1844
and friendliness manifested on every hand	O O O O O O	disgust	1844
nor help awarding unstinted praise to whoever had been the means of bringing about so desirable a state of things.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1844
but ten thousand times better thus than such scenes of lust let loose and abandoned animalism as we witnessed at Honolulu	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1845
What pleased me mightily was the absence of the white man with his air of superiority and sleek overlordship	O B-EMO O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1845
All the worship	O O O	happiness	1845
all the management of affairs	O O O O O	happiness	1845
was entirely in the hands of the natives themselves	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1845
and excellently well did they manage everything.	O O O O O O O	happiness	1845
What a sigh	O O O	happiness	1846
One looked at the other inquiringly	O O O O O O	happiness	1846
but the repetition of that long expiration satisfied us all that it was the placid breathing of the whale we sought somewhere close at hand	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU B-EMO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1846
The light grew rapidly better	O O O O O	happiness	1846
and we strained our eyes in every direction to discover the whereabouts of our friend	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1846
but	O	happiness	1846
for some minutes without result.	O O O O O	happiness	1846
News of our coming had preceded us	O O O O O O O	happiness	1847
and the whole native population appeared to be afloat to make us welcome	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1847
The air rang again with their shouts of rejoicing	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1847
for our catch represented to them a gorgeous feast	O B-CAU I-CAU O O O O B-EMO I-EMO	happiness	1847
such as they had not indulged in for many a day	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1847
The flesh of the humpbacked whale is not at all bad	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1847
being but little inferior to that of the porpoise	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1847
That being settled	O O O	disgust	1848
we anchored the boat	O O O O	disgust	1848
and lit pipes	O O O	disgust	1848
preparatory to passing as comfortable a night as might be under the circumstances	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1848
the only thing troubling me being the anxiety of the skipper on our behalf	O O O B-EMO O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	1848
Presently the blackness beneath was lit up by a wide band of phosphoric light	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1848
shed in the wake of no ordinary-sized fish	O O O O O O O O	disgust	1848
probably an immense shark.	O O O O	disgust	1848
But we lost no time in getting back to the ship	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1849
where I fully expected a severe wigging for the scrape my luckless curiosity had led me into	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1849
The captain	O O	happiness	1849
however	O	happiness	1849
was very kind	O O O	happiness	1849
expressing his pleasure at seeing us all safe back again	O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1849
although he warned me solemnly against similar investigations in future	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1849
A hearty meal and a good rest did wonders in removing the severe effects of our adventure	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1849
so that by next morning we were all fit and ready for the days work again.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1849
But	O	surprise	1850
alas for the fruit of our labours	O O O O O O O	surprise	1850
Those hungry monsters had collected in thousands	O O O O O O O	surprise	1850
and	O	surprise	1850
to judge from what we were able to see of the body	O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1850
they had reduced its value alarmingly	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU B-EMO	surprise	1850
However	O	surprise	1850
we commenced towing	O O O	surprise	1850
and were getting along fairly well	O O O O O O	surprise	1850
when a long spur of reef to leeward of us	O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1850
over which the sea was breaking frightfully	O O O O O O O	surprise	1850
seemed to be stretching farther out to intercept us before we could get into smooth water.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1850
Taking stock of him quietly during our day-long leisurely cruises in the boat	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1851
I often wondered whether his mind still kept its gloomy forebodings	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1851
and brooded over his tragical life-history	O O O O O O	fear	1851
I never dared to speak to him on the subject	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1851
for fear of arousing what I hoped was growing too faint for remembrance	O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1851
But at times I saw him in the moonlit evenings sitting on the rail alone	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1851
steadfastly gazing down into the star-besprent waters beneath him	O O O O O O O O O	fear	1851
as if coveting their unruffled peace.	O O O O O O	fear	1851
A corn-cob cigarette closed the banquet	O O O O O O	sadness	1852
After expressing my thanks	O O O O	sadness	1852
I noticed that the pain of his leg was giving my friend considerable uneasiness	O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O B-EMO	sadness	1852
which he was stolidly enduring upon my account rather than appear discourteously anxious to get rid of me.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1852
islands	O	happiness	1853
air	O	happiness	1853
and sea all shimmering in an enchanted haze	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1853
and silence scarcely broken by the tender ripple of the gently-parted waters before the boat's steady keel--though these joys have all been lost to me	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1853
"and I in ""populous city pent"" endure the fading years"	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1853
I would not barter the memory of them for more than I can say	O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O	happiness	1853
so sweet it is to me	O B-EMO O O O O	happiness	1853
And	O	happiness	1853
then	O	happiness	1853
our relations with the natives had been so perfectly amicable	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1853
so free from anything to regret.	O O O O O O	happiness	1853
And	O	happiness	1854
then	O	happiness	1854
our relations with the natives had been so perfectly amicable	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1854
so free from anything to regret	O O O O O O	happiness	1854

Frode was lying in his house	O O O O O O	happiness	1886
in royal fashion	O O O	happiness	1886
upon cushions of cloth of gold	O O O O O O	happiness	1886
and a certain Hunding challenged him to fight	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1886
Then	O	happiness	1886
though he had bent his mind to the joys of wassail	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1886
he had more delight in the prospect of a fray than in the presence of a feast	O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O	happiness	1886
and wound up the supper with a duel and the duel with a triumph.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1886
Now Urse	O O	fear	1887
who had watched her chance for the deed of guile	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1887
on the third day of the banquet	O O O O O O O	fear	1887
without her husband ever dreaming of such a thing	O O O O O O O O O	fear	1887
put all the king's wealth into carriages	O O O O O O O	fear	1887
and going out stealthily	O O O O	fear	1887
stole away from her own dwelling and fled in the glimmering twilight	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1887
departing with her son	O O O O	fear	1887
Thrilled with fear of her husband's pursuit	O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1887
and utterly despairing of escape beyond	O O O O O O	fear	1887
she begged and bade her companions to cast away the money	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1887
declaring that they must lose either life or riches	O O O O O O O O O	fear	1887
the short and only path to safety lay in flinging away the treasure	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1887
nor could any aid to escape be found save in the loss of their possessions.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1887
So Athisl	O O	happiness	1888
when he saw the necklace that he had given to Rolf left among the other golden ornaments	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1888
gazed fixedly upon the dearest treasure of his avarice	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1888
and	O	happiness	1888
in order to pick up the plunder	O O O O O O O	happiness	1888
glued his knees to the earth and deigned to stoop his royalty unto greed	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1888
Rolf	O	happiness	1888
seeing him lie abjectly on his face in order to gather up the money	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1888
smiled at the sight of a man prostrated by his own gifts	B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1888
just as if he were seeking covetously to regain what he had craftily yielded up	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1888
The Swedes were content with their booty	O O O O O O O	happiness	1888
and Rolf quickly retired to his ships	O O O O O O O	happiness	1888
and managed to escape by rowing violently.	O O O O O O O	happiness	1888
If thou refuse thy daughter	O O O O O	happiness	1889
consent to fight: thou must needs grant one thing or the other We wish either to die or to have our prayers beard Something -- sorrow if not joy -- we will get from thee Frode will be better pleased to hear of our slaughter than of our repulse	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O	happiness	1889
Without another word	O O O	happiness	1889
he threatened to aim a blow at the king's throat with his sword The king replied that it was unseemly for the royal majesty to meet an inferior in rank in level combat	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1889
and unfit that those of unequal station should fight as equals.	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1889
They found that Ragnar was dead	O O O O O O	fear	1891
and that Kraka had already married one Brak	O O O O O O O O	fear	1891
Then they remembered the father's treasure	O O O O O O	fear	1891
dug up the money	O O O O	fear	1891
and bore it off	O O O O	fear	1891
But Erik's fame had gone before him	O O O O O O O	fear	1891
and Gotar had learnt all his good fortune	O O O O O O O O	fear	1891
Now when Gotar learnt that he had come himself	O O O O O O O O O	fear	1891
he feared that his immense self-confidence would lead him to plan the worst against the Norwegians	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1891
and was anxious to take his wife from him and marry him to his own daughter in her place: for his queen had just died	O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O	fear	1891
and he was anxious to marry the sister of Frode more than anyone.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1891
They were Goliath and the skipper	O O O O O O	sadness	1893
Captain Slocum's right hand went naturally to his hip pocket	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1893
where he always carried a revolver	O O O O O O	sadness	1893
but before he could draw it	O O O O O O	sadness	1893
the long	B-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1893
black arms of his adversary wrapped around him	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1893
making him helpless as a babe	O O B-EMO O O O	sadness	1893
Then	O	sadness	1893
with a rush that sent every one flying out of his way	O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1893
Goliath hurled himself at the bulwarks	O O O O O O	sadness	1893
which were low	O O O	sadness	1893
the top of the rail about thirty-three inches from the deck	O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1893
The two bodies struck the rail with a heavy thud	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1893
instantly toppling overboard	O O O	sadness	1893
That broke the spell that bound everybody	O O O O O O O	sadness	1893
so that there was an instantaneous rush to the side	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1893
Only a hardly noticeable ripple remained on the surface of the placid sea.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1893
Next he attacked and killed Hather in Jutland	O O O O O O O O	anger	1894
and his fall is marked by the lasting name of the town	O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1894
After this he overthrew Hunding and Rorik	O O O O O O O	anger	1894
seized Leire	O O	anger	1894
and reunited the dismembered realm of Denmark into its original shape	O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1894
Then he found that Asmund	O O O O O	anger	1894
the King of the Wikars	O O O O O	anger	1894
had been deprived of his throne by his elder sister	O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1894
and	O	anger	1894
angered by such presumption on the part of a woman	B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	1894
went to Norway with a single ship	O O O O O O O	anger	1894
while the war was still undecided	O O O O O O	anger	1894
to help him	O O O	anger	1894
The battle began	O O O	anger	1894
and	O	anger	1894
clothed in a purple cloak	O O O O O	anger	1894
with a coif broidered with gold	O O O O O O	anger	1894
and with his hair bound up	O O O O O O	anger	1894
he went against the enemy trusting not in arms	O O O O O O O O O	anger	1894
but in his silent certainty of his luck	O O O O O O O O	anger	1894
insomuch that he seemed dressed more for a feast than a fray.	O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1894
Then Thorkill	O O	happiness	1895
seeing that they were of two minds	O O O O O O O	happiness	1895
dispelled their hesitation to enter by manful encouragement	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1895
counselling them	O O	happiness	1895
to restrain themselves	O O O	happiness	1895
and not to touch any piece of gear in the house they were about to enter	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1895
albeit it seemed delightful to have or pleasant to behold	O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1895
to keep their hearts as far from all covetousness as from fear	O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1895
neither to desire what was pleasant to take	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1895
nor dread what was awful to look upon	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1895
though they should find themselves amidst abundance of both these things.	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1895
Thus SIWARD	O O	happiness	1897
by the sovereign vote of the whole Danish assembly	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1897
received the empire of his father	O O O O O O	happiness	1897
But after the defeats he had inflicted everywhere he was satisfied with the honour he received at home	O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1897
and liked better to be famous with the gown than with the sword.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1897
Straightway he sought medicine for his grief in loneliness	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1898
and patiently confined the grief of his sick soul within the walls of his house	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1898
But this bitter sorrow was driven out of him by the sudden arrival of Iwar	O O O B-EMO O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1898
who had been expelled from the kingdom	O O O O O O O	sadness	1898
For the Gauls had made him fly	O O O O O O O	sadness	1898
and had wrongfully bestowed royal power on a certain Ella	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1898
the son of Hame.	O O O O	sadness	1898
Poor lady	O O	fear	1900
she never knew how sore that boy's feet had been	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1900
nor how many times he had gone with half a meal or none at all	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1900
for fear of depleting too much the small store she had given him when he left home.	O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1900
Then	O	happiness	1901
to prevent any more troublesome business delaying his hopes of marriage	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1901
he went back to Gewar and enjoyed the coveted embraces of Nanna	O O O O O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1901
Next	O	happiness	1901
having treated Helgi and Thora very generously	O O O O O O O	happiness	1901
he brought his new queen back to Sweden	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1901
being as much honoured by all for his victory as Balder was laughed at for his flight.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1901
But Odin	O O	disgust	1902
who had found that nothing served the wishes of lovers more than tough persistency	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1902
though he was stung with the shame of his double rebuff	O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	1902
nevertheless	O	disgust	1902
effacing the form he had worn before	O O O O O O O	disgust	1902
went to the king for the third time	O O O O O O O O	disgust	1902
professing the completest skill in soldiership.	O O O O O O	disgust	1902
So he besought them to make his son RORIK king	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1903
so that the judgment of wicked men should not transfer the royalty to strange and unknown houses	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1903
averring that he would reap more joy from the succession of his son than bitterness from his own impending death	O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O	happiness	1903
This request was speedily granted.	O O O O O	happiness	1903
Drawing him by those appeals	O O O O O	fear	1904
and warily noting the right spot to plant his blow	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1904
he turned the other edge of his sword to the front	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1904
fearing that the thin side of his blade was too frail for his strength	B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1904
and smote with a piercing stroke through the prince's body	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1904
When Wermund heard it	O O O O	fear	1904
"he said that the sound of his sword ""Skrep"" had reached his ear for the second time."	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1904
He had several times taken caravans to Karague	O O O O O O O O	sadness	1905
and knew all the languages well	O O O O O O	sadness	1905
but unfortunately he afterwards proved to be what his name implied	O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1905
That	O	sadness	1905
however	O	sadness	1905
I could not foresee	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1905
so	O	sadness	1905
trusting to him and good-luck	O O O O O	sadness	1905
I commenced making fresh enlistments of porters	O O O O O O O	sadness	1905
but they came and went in the most tantalising manner	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1905
notwithstanding I offered three times the hire that any merchant could afford to give.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1905
This night one was shot	O O O O O	happiness	1906
without any mistake about it	O O O O O	happiness	1906
for the next morning we tracked him by his blood	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1906
and afterwards heard he had died of his wound	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1906
The Wasui elders	O O O	happiness	1906
contrary to my expectation	O O O O	happiness	1906
then came and congratulated us on our success	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1906
They thought us most wonderful men	O O O O B-EMO O	happiness	1906
and possessed of supernatural powers	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1906
for the thief in question was a magician	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1906
who until now was thought to be invulnerable	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1906
Indeed	O	happiness	1906
they said Arabs with enormous caravans had often been plundered by these people	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1906
but though they had so many more guns than ourselves	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1906
they never succeeded in killing one.	O O O O O O	happiness	1906
At his invitation we now crossed over the spur to the Ingezi Kagera side	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1907
when	O	surprise	1907
to surprise me	O B-EMO O	surprise	1907
the canoes I had come up the lake in appeared before us	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1907
They had gone out of the lake at its northern end	O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1907
paddled into	O O	surprise	1907
and then up the Kagera to where we stood	O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1907
showing	O	surprise	1907
by actual navigation	O O O	surprise	1907
the connection of these highland lakes with the rivers which drain the various spurs of the Mountains of the Moon.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1907
A man from Ruanda then told us of the Wilyanwantu (men-eaters)	O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1908
who disdained all food but human flesh	O O O O O O O	disgust	1908
and Rumanika confirmed the statement	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	1908
Though I felt very sceptical  about it	O O O O B-EMO O O O	disgust	1908
I could not help thinking it a curious coincidence that the position they were said to occupy agreed with Petherick's Nyam Nyams (men-eaters).	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1908
No one knew of a lake to supply the waters	O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1909
nor where they came from	O O O O O	surprise	1909
That they flowed into the lake there was no doubt--as I could see by the trickling waters in some few places--and they lay exactly on the equator	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1909
Rising out of the valley	O O O O O	surprise	1909
I found all the country just as hilly as before	O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1909
but many of the rush-drains going to northward	O O O O O O O O	surprise	1909
and in the dells were such magnificent trees	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1909
they quite took me by surprise	O O O O O B-EMO	surprise	1909
Clean-trunked	O	surprise	1909
they towered up just as so many great pillars	O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1909
and then spread out their high branches like a canopy over us	O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1909
I thought of the blue gums of Australia	O O O O O O O O	surprise	1909
and believed these would beat them.	O O O O O O	surprise	1909
This double failure was a more serious affair then a mere slight	O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1910
for my cows were eaten up	O O O O O O	sadness	1910
and my men clamouring incessantly for food	O O O O O O O	sadness	1910
"and though they might by orders help themselves ""ku n'yangania""--by seizing--from the Waganda"	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O	sadness	1910
it hurt my feelings so much to witness this	O B-EMO O O O O O O O	sadness	1910
that I tried from the first to dispense with it	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1910
telling the king I had always flogged my men for stealing	O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1910
and now he turned them into a pack of thieves.	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1910
About a year later	O O O O	sadness	1914
Mr Semple died	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1914
It was an untimely death	O O O O O	sadness	1914
one of those fortuitous and in a way insignificant episodes which are	O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1914
nevertheless	O	sadness	1914
dramatic in a dull way to those most concerned	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1914
He was seized with a cold in the chest late in the fall--one of those seizures ordinarily attributed to wet feet or to going out on a damp day without an overcoat--and had insisted on going to business when Mrs	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1914
Semple urged him to stay at home and recuperate	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1914
He was in his way a very determined person	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1914
not obstreperously so	O O O	sadness	1914
but quietly and under the surface	O O O O O O	sadness	1914
Business was a great urge	O O O O O	sadness	1914
He saw himself soon to be worth about fifty thousand dollars	O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1914
Then this cold--nine more days of pneumonia--and he was dead	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1914
The shoe store was closed for a few days	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1914
the house was full of sympathetic friends and church people	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1914
There was a funeral	O O O O	sadness	1914
with burial service in the Callowhill Presbyterian Church	O O O O O O O O	sadness	1914
to which they belonged	O O O O	sadness	1914
and then he was buried	O O O O O	sadness	1914
Mrs	O	sadness	1914
Semple cried bitterly	O O O	sadness	1914
The shock of death affected her greatly and left her for a time in a depressed state	O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1914
A brother of hers	O O O O	sadness	1914
David Wiggin	O O	sadness	1914
undertook for the time being to run the shoe business for her	O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1914
There was no will	O O O O	sadness	1914
but in the final adjustment	O O O O O	sadness	1914
which included the sale of the shoe business	O O O O O O O O	sadness	1914
there being no desire on anybody's part to contest her right to all the property	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1914
she received over eighteen thousand dollars	O O O O O O	sadness	1914
She continued to reside in the Front Street house	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1914
and was considered a charming and interesting widow.	O O O O O O O O	sadness	1914
It was while he was calling on her in this way that his Uncle Seneca died in Cuba and left him fifteen thousand dollars	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1916
This money made him worth nearly twenty-five thousand dollars in his own right	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1916
and he knew exactly what to do with it	O O O O O O O O O	fear	1916
A panic had come since Mr Semple had died	O B-EMO O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1916
which had illustrated to him very clearly what an uncertain thing the brokerage business was	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1916
There was really a severe business depression.	O O O O O O O	fear	1916
Either the well was very deep	O O O O O O	surprise	1917
or she fell very slowly	O O O O O	surprise	1917
for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen nextFirst	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1917
she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1917
but it was too dark to see anything	O O O O O O O O	surprise	1917
then she looked at the sides of the well	O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1917
and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves	O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1917
here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegsShe took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1917
it was labelled `ORANGE MARMALADE'	O O O O O	surprise	1917
but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody	O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1917

`after such a fall as this	O O O O O O	surprise	1917

Why	O	surprise	1917
I wouldn't say anything about it	O O O O O O	surprise	1917
even if I fell off the top of the house	O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1917
And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1919
and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely gardenFirst	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1919
however	O	fear	1919
she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this	O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O B-EMO O O	fear	1919

`in my going out altogether	O O O O O	fear	1919
like a candleI wonder what I should be like then	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1919

for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1919
Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1920
and found in it a very small cake	O O O O O O O O	surprise	1920
on which the words `EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants`Well	O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1920
I'll eat it	O O O	surprise	1920

`and if it makes me grow larger	O O O O O O O	surprise	1920
I can reach the key	O O O O O	surprise	1920

I can creep under the door	O O O O O O	surprise	1920
so either way I'll get into the garden	O O O O O O O O	surprise	1920

this generally happens when one eats cake	O O O O O O O	surprise	1920

that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1920
she set to work	O O O O	surprise	1920

the chasm	O O	happiness	1933

a string of pearls about the white neck of Mary Antrim	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1941

never in his life to go near her	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1942

however	O	surprise	1943
after a  while	O O O O	surprise	1943

in the depth of which - it  formed a dim vestibule - the raising of a curtain at the moment he  passed gave him a glimpse of an avenue of gloom with a glow of  tapers at the end.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1943

abounding himself and yet not able  to overflow - a demonstration that would have been signally a false  note.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1944

Jobs spent a few days in Munich	O O O O O O O	disgust	1
where he solved the interference problem	O O O O O O	disgust	1
but in the process he flummoxed the dark-suited German managers	O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1

His argument was that a great engineer would be remembered only if he teamed with a great marketer	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	11
and this required him to commit his designs to the partnership	O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	11
Jobs was so impressed and grateful that he offered Wayne a 10% stake in the new partnership	O O O O O B-EMO O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	11
turning him into a tie-breaker if Jobs and Wozniak disagreed over an issue.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	11

but Wayne (who worried about a global financial Armageddon) kept gold coins hidden in his mattress	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	13
Because they had structured Apple as a simple partnership rather than a corporation	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	13
the partners would be personally liable for the debts	O O O O O O O O O	fear	13
and Wayne was afraid potential creditors would go after him.	O O B-EMO I-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	13
Clara Jobs didn't mind losing most of her house to piles of parts and houseguests	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	15
but she was frustrated by her son's increasingly quirky diets.	O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	15
What bothered him more was that Jobs knew nothing about marketing and seemed content to peddle his product to individual stores one by one.	O B-EMO O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	20

Brennan's family was surprised	O O O B-EMO	surprise	26

Atkinson and others had read some of the papers published by Xerox PARC	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	28
so they knew they were not getting a full description	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	28
Jobs phoned the head of the Xerox venture capital division to complain	O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO	disgust	28
a call immediately came back from corporate headquarters in Connecticut decreeing that Jobs and his group should be shown everything.	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	28
He was working so hard that one morning	O O O O O O O O	fear	30
in a daze	O O O	fear	30
he drove his Corvette into a parked truck and nearly killed himself	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	30
Jobs immediately drove to the hospital to see him	O O O O O O O O O	fear	30
We were pretty worried about you	O O O B-EMO I-EMO O	fear	30
he said when Atkinson regained consciousness.	O O O O O O	fear	30
Both Mike Scott and Mike Markkula were intent on bringing some order to Apple and became increasingly concerned about Jobs's disruptive behavior	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	33
So in September 1980	O O O O	fear	33
they secretly plotted a reorganization.	O O O O O	fear	33
What was really so difficult for me is that Steve never told me I wasn't eligible	O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	35
recalled Kottke.	O O	sadness	35
But when he got in to see him	O O O O O O O O	anger	36
Jobs was so cold that Kottke froze	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	36
I just got choked up and began to cry and just couldn't talk to him	O O O B-EMO I-EMO O O O O O O O O O O	anger	36
Kottke recalled	O O	anger	36
Our friendship was all gone	O O O O O	anger	36
It was so sad.	O O O O	anger	36
Jobs even tried to reengage Wozniak	O O O O O O	disgust	38
I resented the fact that he had not been doing much	O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	38
but then I thought	O O O O	disgust	38
hell	O	disgust	38
I wouldn't be here without his brilliance	O O O O O O O	disgust	38
Jobs later told me.	O O O O	disgust	38
One day Jobs came into the cubicle of Larry Kenyon	O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	41
an engineer who was working on the Macintosh operating system	O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	41
and complained that it was taking too long to boot up.	O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	41
He also admired the design of the Mercedes.	O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	42
He had just come up with a brilliant algorithm that could draw circles and ovals onscreen quickly	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	44
The math for making circles usually required calculating square roots	O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	44
which the 68000 microprocessor didn't support	O O O O O O	surprise	44
But Atkinson did a workaround based on the fact that the sum of a sequence of odd numbers produces a sequence of perfect squares (for example	O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O	surprise	44
1 + 3 = 4	O O O O O	surprise	44
1 + 3 + 5 = 9	O O O O O O O	surprise	44
etc	O	surprise	44
Hertzfeld recalled that when Atkinson fired up his demo	O O O O O O O O O	surprise	44
everyone was impressed except Jobs.	O O B-EMO O O	surprise	44
Atkinson had been left out of the publicity interviews for the Lisa launch	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	47
and he marched into Jobs's hotel room and threatened to quit	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	47
Jobs tried to minimize the slight	O O O O O O	anger	47
but Atkinson refused to be mollified	O O O O O O	anger	47
Jobs got annoyed.	O O B-EMO	anger	47
But by the time the Lisa was ready to ship in the spring of 1983	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	48
it was clear that the Twiggy was buggy	O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	48
Because the Lisa also came with a hard-disk drive	O O O O O O O O O	fear	48
this was not a complete disaster	O O O O O O	fear	48
But the Mac had no hard disk	O O O O O O O	fear	48
so it faced a crisis	O O O O O	fear	48
The Mac team was beginning to panic	O O O O O O B-EMO	fear	48
said Hertzfeld.	O O	fear	48
A few days later he drove to Apple's factory in San Jose to see the Twiggy being made	O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	49
More than half were rejected	O O O O O	anger	49
Jobs erupted	O B-EMO	anger	49
With his face flushed	O O O O	anger	49
he began shouting and sputtering about firing everyone who worked there.	O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O O O O O O	anger	49
He took them to visit a computer store	O O O O O O O O	surprise	50
where he was struck by how poorly the products were marketed.	O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	50
When he arrived at Apple headquarters	O O O O O O	surprise	51
Sculley was startled by the unassuming offices and casual atmosphere.	O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	51
The explanation that Sculley might buy a lot of Macintoshes for Pepsi sounded a little bit fishy to me	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	53
Hertzfeld recalled	O O	happiness	53
but he and Susan Kare created a screen of Pepsi caps and cans that danced around with the Apple logo	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	53
Hertzfeld was so excited he began waving his arms around during the demo	O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O O O	happiness	53
but Sculley seemed underwhelmed.	O O O O	happiness	53
To him	O O	anger	55
the marketing costs were like any other production cost and needed to be factored into the price	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	55
Jobs resisted furiously.	O B-EMO I-EMO	anger	55
So Jobs promised them	O O O O	anger	56
don't worry	O O	anger	56
I'm not going to let him get away with it	O O O O O O O O O O	anger	56
But in the end	O O O O	anger	56
Sculley prevailed	O O	anger	56
Even twenty-five years later Jobs seethed when recalling the decision: It's the main reason the Macintosh sales slowed and Microsoft got to dominate the market.	O O O O O B-EMO O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	56
Hertzfeld	O	happiness	57

replied	O	happiness	57
We don't have any special hardware for it	O O O O O O O O	happiness	57
Gates insisted that it was necessary to have special hardware to move the cursor that way.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	57
Despite their mutual wariness	O O O O	happiness	58
both teams were excited by the prospect that Microsoft would create graphical software for the Macintosh that would take personal computing into a new realm	O O O B-EMO O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	58
and they went to dinner at a fancy restaurant to celebrate.	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	58
But this arrangement upset competing software makers	O O O B-EMO O O O	happiness	59
In addition	O O	happiness	59
it seemed that some of Microsoft's programs might be late	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	59
So Jobs invoked a provision in his deal with Microsoft and decided not to bundle its software	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	59
Microsoft would have to scramble to distribute its software as products sold directly to consumers.	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	59
As Jobs and his team began to work closely with Microsoft	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	60
they grew worried that it would copy Macintosh's graphical user interface.	O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	60
After Jobs talked about the just-in-time production schedules	O O O O O O O O	anger	62
she asked about overtime pay	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	62
He was annoyed	O O B-EMO	anger	62

a subject he knew would not delight her.	O O O O O O O O	anger	62
Is it hard work	O O O O	disgust	63
she asked	O O	disgust	63

Gass��e got angry.	O B-EMO I-EMO	anger	65

By early 1985 Burrell Smith was also ready to leave	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	69

Jobs was annoyed.	O O B-EMO	anger	76
Lewin's university consortium had been a godsend to the Macintosh group	O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	77

What particularly struck Nocera was Jobs's almost willful lack of tact.	O O B-EMO O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	79
In the spring of 1988 cash was running so short that he convened a meeting to decree deep spending cuts across the board	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	80

because he was one of my heroes	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	98

He was as sharp as a tack.	O O O O O O O	fear	98

Bewkes told him.	O O O	happiness	102
They are scared to death	O O B-EMO O B-CAU	fear	103

I'm not worried about that	O O B-EMO I-EMO O	fear	104

He was given the command of another expedition which left England in April 1860	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	106
in company with Captain James Augustus Grant	O O O O O O O	sadness	106

Lines of traffic are the worst tracks (there are no roads in the districts here referred to) for a traveller to go upon	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	110
not only because the hospitality of the people has been damped by frequent communication with travellers	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	110

The slave in this new position finds himself much better off than he ever was in his life before	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	113
with this exception	O O O	happiness	113
that as a slave he feels himself much degraded in the social scale of society	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	113

according to the Mohammedan creed the slaves ought to be freed	O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	114
In Arabia this would be the case	O O O O O O O	disgust	114

on the march he is no better	O O O O O O O	surprise	115
If you give him a gun and some ammunition to protect him in case of emergencies	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	115
he will promise to save it	O O O O O O	surprise	115
but forthwith expends it by firing it off in the air	O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	115

without a moment's delay I went off to the British Consulate to see my old friend Colonel Rigby	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	116
He was delighted to see us	O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU	happiness	116

in anticipation of our arrival	O O O O O	happiness	116
had prepared rooms for our reception	O O O O O O	happiness	116
that both Captain Grant and myself might enjoy his hospitality until arrangements could be made for our final start into the interior.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	116

Colonel Rigby	O O	happiness	118
who had at heart as much as anybody the success of the expedition	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	118

On my return to Zanzibar	O O O O O	happiness	119

embarking at noon	O O O	happiness	119

we lay-to that night at Tombat	O O O O O O	happiness	119
with a view of surprising the slaver next morning	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	119
We had a brave crew of young negroes to pull us	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	120
but	O	fear	120
pull as they would	O O O O	fear	120
the current was so strong that we feared	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O B-EMO	fear	120
if we persisted	O O O	fear	120
we should be drawn into the broad Indian Ocean	O O O O O O O O O	fear	120
so	O	fear	120
changing our line	O O O	fear	120
we bore into the little coralline island	O O O O O O O	fear	120
Maziwa	O	fear	120

we put in for the night.	O O O O O O	fear	120
They both knew Hindustani	O O O O	happiness	123
but while Rahan's services at sea had been short	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	123
Baraka had served nearly all his life with Englishmen--was the smartest and most intelligent negro I ever saw--was invaluable to Colonel Rigby as a detector of slave-traders	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O B-EMO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	123

that he said	O O O	happiness	123
on parting with him	O O O O	happiness	123
that he did not know where he should be able to find another man to fill his post.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	123
wo taxes in five miles was a thing unheard of	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	124
and I heard no more about the matter	O O O O O O O O	fear	124
until Bombay in the evening told me how Sheikh Said	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	124
fearing awkward consequences	B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU	fear	124
had settled to give two dubuani	O O O O O O	fear	124
one being taken from his own store	O O O O O O O	fear	124
Lion's Claw also turned up again	O O O O O O	fear	124
getting his cloths of yesterday--one more being added from the Sheikh's stores--and he was then advised to go off quietly	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	124
as I was a fire-eater whom nobody dared approach after my orders had been issued.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	124
At the advice of Musa	O O O O O	sadness	127
I sent Maula's son off at night to tell the old chief how sorry I was to find the Arabs so hot-headed I could not even effect an arrangement with them	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	127
It was a great pity	O O O O B-EMO	sadness	127
for Manua Sera was so much liked by the Wanyamuezi	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	127
they would	O O	sadness	127
had they been able	O O O O	sadness	127
have done anything to restore him.	O O O O O O	sadness	127
Next day the non-belligerent Arabs left in charge of the station	O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	128
headed by my old friends Abdulla and Mohinna	O O O O O O O O	sadness	128
came to pay their respects again	O O O O O O	sadness	128
recognising in me	O O O	sadness	128
as they said	O O O	sadness	128
"a ""personification of their sultan"	O O O O O	sadness	128
""" and therefore considering what they were doing only due to my rank"	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	128
They regretted with myself that Snay was so hot-headed	O B-EMO O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	128
for they themselves thought a treaty of peace would have been the best thing for them	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	128
for they were more than half-ruined already	O O O O O O O	sadness	128

Then	O	sadness	128
turning to geography	O O O	sadness	128
I told Abdulla all I had written and lectured in England concerning his stories about navigators on the N'yanza	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	128
which I explained must be the Nile	O O O O O O O	sadness	128

I now gave all my men presents for the severe trials they had experienced in the wilderness	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	129
forgetting	O	disgust	129

enlarging my zoological collection	O O O O	sadness	130

when the whole of Kaze was depressed by a sad scene of mourning and tears	O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	130
Some slaves came in that night--having made their way through the woods from Ugogo	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	130
avoiding the track to save themselves from detection-- and gave information that Snay	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	130

came to me again in a body	O O O O O O O	sadness	131

for they were utterly undone	O O O O O	sadness	131
Manua Sera prevented their direct communication with their detachment at Mdaburu	O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	131

after two or three of their number had been killed	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	133
dispersed	O	fear	133
and feared to come near his musket again	O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	133
He visited Uganda when the late king Sunna was living	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	133
and even traded Usoga	O O O O	fear	133
Adding a little advice of his own	O O O O O O O	disgust	134
Sheikh Said pressed me to go on with the journey as fast as possible	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	134
because all the Arabs had accused me of conspiring with Manua Sera	O O O O O B-EMO O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	134
and would turn against me unless I soon got away.	O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	134
He was a fine- looking young man	O O O O O O O	surprise	135
about thirty years old	O O O O	surprise	135
the husband of thirty wives	O O O O O	surprise	135
but he had only three children	O O O O O O	surprise	135
Much surprised at the various articles composing our kit	O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	135
"he remarked that our ""sleeping-clothes""--blankets--were much better than his royal robes"	O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	135
but of all things that amused him most were our picture- books	O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	135
especially some birds drawn by Wolf.	O O O O O O	surprise	135
after being humbugged so many times by his procrastinations	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	136
I gave Sheikh Said more letters and specimens	O O O O O O O O	happiness	136
with orders to take the Tots down to the coast as soon as practicable	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	136
and started once more for the north	O O O O O O O	happiness	136
expecting very shortly to hear of Musa's death	O O O O O O O O	happiness	136
though he promised to follow me the very next day or die in the attempt	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	136
and he also said he would bring on the four men required by Suwarora	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	136
for I was fully satisfied in my mind that he would have marched with me then had he had the resolution to do so at all.	O O O O B-EMO O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	136
My patience was beginning to suffer again	O O O O O B-EMO O	sadness	138
for I could not help thinking that the chiefs of the place were preventing their village men going with me in order that my presence here might ward of the Watuta	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	138
so I called up the kirangozi	O O O O O O	sadness	138
"who had thirteen ""Watoto"	O O O O	sadness	138
""" as they are called"	O O O O O	sadness	138
or children of his own	O O O O O	sadness	138
wishing to go	O O O	sadness	138
and asked him if he knew why no other men could be got.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	138
My men had greatly amused him by firing their guns off and showing him the use of their sword-bayonets	O O O O B-EMO O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	139
I knew	O O	happiness	139
as a matter of course	O O O O O	happiness	139
that if I stopped any longer I should be teased for more cloths	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	139
and gave orders to my men to march the same instant	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	139
saying	O	happiness	139
if they did not--for I saw them hesitate--I would give the cows to the villagers	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	139
since I knew that was the thing that weighed on their minds.	O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	139
This provoked fresh squabbles	O O O O	sadness	140
The drums had beaten and the tax was settled	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	140
I could not pay more	O O O O O	sadness	140
The kirangozi	O O	sadness	140
however	O	sadness	140
said he would not move a peg unless I gave something more	O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	140
else he would be seized on his way back	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	140
"His ""children' all said the same"	O O O O O O	sadness	140
and as I thought Grant would only be worsted if I did not keep friends with the scoundrel	O O O O O O O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	140
I gave four yards more merikani	O O O O O O	sadness	140
and then went on my way.	O O O O O O	sadness	140
At length giving in	O O O O	fear	141
I entered Ruhe's boma	O O O O	fear	141
the poles of which were decked with the skulls of his enemies stuck upon them	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	141
Instead	O	fear	141
however	O	fear	141
of seeing him myself	O O O O	fear	141
as he feared my evil eye	O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	141
I conducted the arrangements for the hongo through Baraka	O O O O O O O O O	fear	141
in the same way as I did at M'yonga's	O O O O O O O O O	fear	141
directing that it should be limited to the small sum of one barsati and four yards kiniki.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	141
This was too provoking	O O O O	fear	142
The perpetual worry had given Baraka a fever	O O B-EMO I-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	142
and had made me feel quite sick	O O O O O O O	fear	142
so I said	O O O	fear	142
if he ever mentioned a gun or lucifers again	O O O O O O O O O	fear	142
I would fight the matter out with him	O O O O O O O O	fear	142
for I had not come there to be bullied	O O O O O O O O O	fear	142
He then gave way	O O O O	fear	142
and begged I would allow my men to fire a volley outside his boma	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	142
as the Watuta were living behind a small line of granitic hills flanking the west of his district	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	142
and he wished to show them what a powerful force he had got with him.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	142
I then told the Pig and Baraka to settle at once	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	143
They no sooner did so than the drums beat	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	143
and Makaka	O O	happiness	143
in the best humour possible	O O O B-EMO O	happiness	143
came over to say I had permission to go when I liked	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	143
but he hoped I would give him a gun and a box of lucifers	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	143
This was too provoking	O O O O	happiness	143
The perpetual worry had given Baraka a fever	O O O O O O O O	happiness	143
and had made me feel quite sick	O O O O O O O	happiness	143
so I said	O O O	happiness	143
if he ever mentioned a gun or lucifers again	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	143
I would fight the matter out with him	O O O O O O O O	happiness	143
for I had not come there to be bullied.	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	143
Whilst engaged in this operation	O O O O O	fear	144
Baraka	O	fear	144
accompanied by Wadimoyo (Heart's-stream)	O O O O	fear	144
another of my freeman	O O O O	fear	144
approached me in great consternation	O O O O O	fear	144
whispering to themselves	O O O	fear	144
They said they had some fearful news to communicate	O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO O O	fear	144
which	O	fear	144
when I heard it	O O O O	fear	144
they knew would deter our progress: it was of such great moment and magnitude	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O	fear	144
they thought they could not deliver it then.	O O O O O O O O	fear	144
Then Baraka said	O O O	anger	145
"""I have just heard from Makaka"	O O O O O O	anger	145
that a man who arrived from Usui only a few minutes ago has said Suwarora is so angry with the Arabs that he has detained one caravan of theirs in his country	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	145
and	O	anger	145
separating the whole of their men	O O O O O O	anger	145
has placed each of them in different bomas	O O O O O O O O	anger	145
with orders to his village officers that	O O O O O O O	anger	145
in case the Watuta came into his country	O O O O O O O O	anger	145
"without further ceremony they were to be all put to death."""	O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	145
This was a fearful drain on my store	O O O O O O O O	anger	146
but the Pig	O O O	anger	146
seeing my concern	O O O	anger	146
merely laughed at it	O O O O	anger	146
and said	O O	anger	146
"""Oh"	O	anger	146
these savage chiefs are all alike here	O O O O O O O	anger	146
you will have one of these taxes to pay every stage to Uyofu	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	146
and then the heavy work will begin	O O O O O O O	anger	146
for all these men	O O O O	anger	146
although they assume the dignity of chief to themselves	O O O O O O O O O	anger	146
are mere officers	O O O	anger	146
who have to pay tribute to Suwarora	O O O O O O O	anger	146
"and he would be angry if they were shortcoming."""	O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	146
These two slaves	O O O	fear	147
both of whom knew all the chiefs and languages up to and including Uganda	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	147
promised me faithfully they would go with Bombay on to Usui	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	147
and bring back porters in sufficient number for Grant and myself to go on together	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	147
They laughed at the stories I told them of the terror that had seized Baraka and all the Wanguana	O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	147
and told me	O O O	fear	147
as old Musa had often done before	O O O O O O O	fear	147
that those men	O O O	fear	147
especially Baraka	O O	fear	147
had from their first leaving Kaze made up their minds they would not enter Usui	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	147
or go anywhere very far north.	O O O O O O	fear	147
Then turning to the animals	O O O O O	anger	148
he roared over each one in turn as he examined them	O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	148
and called out their names	O O O O O	anger	148
My bull's-eye lantern he coveted so much	O O O O O O O	anger	148
I had to pretend exceeding anger to stop his further importunities	O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	148
He then began again begging for lucifers	O O O O O O O	anger	148
which charmed him so intensely I thought I should never get rid of him.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	148
whilst in the valley there were not only magnificent trees of extraordinary height	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	149
but also a surprising amount of the richest cultivation	O O O O O O O O O	disgust	149
amongst which the banana may be said to prevail	O O O O O O O O O	disgust	149
Notwithstanding this apparent richness in the land	O O O O O O O	disgust	149
the Wanyambo	O O	disgust	149
living in their small squalid huts	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	149
seem poor	O B-EMO	disgust	149
The tobacco they smoke is imported from the coffee-growing country of Uhaiya.	O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	149
Leaving the valley of Uthenga	O O O O O	happiness	151
we rose over the spur of N'yamwara	O O O O O O O	happiness	151
where we found we had attained the delightful altitude of 5000 odd feet	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	151
@ Oh	O O	happiness	151
how we enjoyed it	O O B-EMO O	happiness	151
every one feeling so happy at the prospect of meeting so soon the good king Rumanika	O O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	151
Tripping down the greensward	O O O O	happiness	151
we now worked our way to the Rozoka valley	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	151
and pitched our tents in the village.	O O O O O O O	happiness	151
Now	O	happiness	152
the real facts of the case were these--though I did not find them out at the time:-- Baraka had bought some slaves with my effects	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	152
and he had had a fight with some of my men because they tampered with his temporary wife--a princess he had picked up in Phunze	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	152
To obtain her hand he had given ten necklaces of MY beads to her mother	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	152
and had agreed to the condition that he should keep the girl during the journey	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	152
and after it was over	O O O O O	happiness	152
and he took her home	O O O O O	happiness	152
he would	O O	happiness	152
if his wife pleased him	O O O B-EMO O	happiness	152
give her mother ten necklaces more.	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	152
Ever anxious to push on with the journey	O O O O O O O O	sadness	153
as I felt every day's delay only tended to diminish my means--that is	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	153
my beads and copper wire--I instructed Bombay to take the under-mentioned articles to Rumanika as a small sample of the products of my country	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	153
[FN11] to say I felt quite ashamed of their being so few and so poor	O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	153
but I hoped he would forgive my shortcomings	O O O O O O O O	sadness	153
as he knew I had been so often robbed on the way to him	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	153
and I trusted	O O O	sadness	153
in recollection of Musa	O O O O	sadness	153
he would give me leave to go on to Uganda	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	153
for every day's delay was consuming my supplies.	O O O O O O O O	sadness	153
Next morning	O O	disgust	154
however	O	disgust	154
on seeing me actually preparing to start	O O O O O O O	disgust	154
Lumeresi found he could not let me go until I increased the tax by three more cloths	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	154
as some of his family complained that they had got nothing	O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	154
After some badgering	O O O	disgust	154
I paid what he asked for	O O O O O O	disgust	154
and ordered the men to carry me out of the palace before anything else was done	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	154
for I would not sleep another night where I was.	O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	154
Neither his father nor any of his forefathers had had such a great favour shown them	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	155
He was alarmed	O O O	happiness	155
he confessed	O O	happiness	155
when he heard we were coming to visit him	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	155
thinking we might prove some fearful monsters that were not quite human	O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	155
but now he was delighted beyond all measure with what he saw of us	O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	155
A messenger should be sent at once to the king of Uganda to inform him of our intention to visit him	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	155
with his own favourable report of us.	O O O O O O O	happiness	155
With at last a sufficiency of porters	O O O O O O O	happiness	156
we all set out together	O O O O O	happiness	156
walking over a new style of country	O O O O O O O	happiness	156
Instead of the constantly- recurring outcrops of granite	O O O O O O O O	happiness	156
as in Unyamuezi	O O O	happiness	156
with valleys between	O O O	happiness	156
there were only two lines of little hills visible	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	156
one right and one left of us	O O O O O O O	happiness	156
a good way off	O O O O	happiness	156
whilst the ground over which we were travelling	O O O O O O O O	happiness	156
instead of being confined like a valley	O O O O O O O	happiness	156
rose in long high swells of sandstone formation	O O O O O O O O	happiness	156
covered with small forest-trees	O O O O	happiness	156
among which flowers like primroses	O O O O O	happiness	156
only very much larger	O O O O	happiness	156
and mostly of a pink colour	O O O O O O	happiness	156
were frequently met with	O O O O	happiness	156
Indeed	O	happiness	156
we ought all to have been happy together	O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO	happiness	156
for all my men were paid and rationed trebly--far better than they would have been if they had been travelling with any one else	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	156
but I had not paid all	O O O O O O	happiness	156
as they thought	O O O	happiness	156
proportionably	O	happiness	156
and therefore there were constant heartburnings	O O O O O O	happiness	156
with strikes and rows every day.	O O O O O O	happiness	156
Here some of the porters	O O O O O	disgust	157
attempting to bolt	O O O	disgust	157
were intercepted by my coast-men and had a fight of it	O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	157
for they fired arrows	O O O O	disgust	157
and in return the coast-men cut their bows	O O O O O O O O	disgust	157
The whole camp	O O O	disgust	157
of course	O O	disgust	157
was in a blaze at this	O O O O O O	disgust	157
their tribe was insulted	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	157
and they would not stand it	O O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO	disgust	157
until Bombay put down their pride with a few strings of beads	O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	157
as the best means of restoring peace in the camp.	O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	157
At this place we were visited by the chief of the district	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	158
Pongo (Bush-boc)	O O	fear	158
who had left his palace to see us and invite us his way	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	158
for he feared we might give him the slip by going west into Uyofu	O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	158
He sent us a cow	O O O O O	fear	158
and said he should like some return	O O O O O O O	fear	158
for Masudi	O O	fear	158
who had gone ahead	O O O O	fear	158
only gave him a trifle	O O O O O	fear	158
professing to be our vanguard	O O O O O	fear	158
and telling him that as soon as we came with the large caravan we would satisfy him to his heart's content.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	158
It was given	O O O	anger	159
after many angry words	O O O O	anger	159
but it was the old story over again-- he would have one more wire and a cloth	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	159
or else he would not allow us to proceed on the morrow	O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	159
My men	O O	anger	159
this time really provoked	O O O B-EMO	anger	159
said they would fight it out	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	159
--a king breaking his word in that way	O O O O O O O O	anger	159
But in the end the demand had to be paid	O O O O O O O O O O	anger	159
and at last	O O O	anger	159
at 9 P	O O O	anger	159
the drums beat the satisfaction.	O O O O O	anger	159
Just then Bombay returned flushed with the excitement of a great success	O O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	161
He had been in Masudi's camp	O O O O O O	happiness	161
and had delivered my message to Insangez	O O O O O O O	happiness	161
Asudi	O	happiness	161
he said	O O	happiness	161
had been there a fortnight unable to settle his hongo	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	161
for the great Mkama had not deigned to see him	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	161
though the Arab had been daily to his palace requesting an interview	O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	161
"""Well"	O	happiness	161
""" I said"	O O O	happiness	161
"""that is all very interesting"	O O O O O	happiness	161
but what next	O O O	happiness	161
--will the big king see us	O O O O O O	happiness	161
On leaving this interesting place	O O O O O	surprise	162
with the widespread information of all the surrounding countries I had gained	O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	162
my mind was so impressed with the topographical features of all this part of Africa	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	162
that in my heart I resolved I would make Rumanika as happy as he had made me	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	162
and asked K'yengo his doctor	O O O O O	surprise	162
of all things I possessed what the king would like best	O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	162
To my surprise I then learnt that Rumanika had set his heart on the revolving rifle I had brought for Mtesa--the one	O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O	surprise	162
in fact	O O	surprise	162
which he had prevented my sending on to Uganda in the hands of Kachuchu	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	162
and he would have begged me for it before had his high-minded dignity	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	162
and the principle he had established of never begging for anything	O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	162
not interfered.	O O	surprise	162
The flatterers said	O O O	happiness	163
"""It is as clear as possible"	O O O O O O	happiness	163
God gave the thunderbolt to Dagaro as a sign he was pleased with him and his rule	O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	163
but when he found two brothers contending	O O O O O O O	happiness	163
"he withdrew it to show their conduct was wicked."""	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	163
Before breaking up	O O O	happiness	164
Rumanika wished to give me any number of ivories I might like to mention	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	164
even three or four hundred	O O O O O	happiness	164
as a lasting remembrance that I had done him the honour of visiting Karague in his lifetime	O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	164
for though Dagara had given to coloured merchants	O O O O O O O O	happiness	164
he would be the first who had given to a white man	O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	164
Of course this royal offer was declined with politeness	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	164
he must understand that it was not the custom of big men in my country to accept presents of value when we made visits of pleasure	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	165
I had enjoyed my residence in Karague	O O O O O O O	happiness	165
his intellectual conversations and his kind hospitality	O O O O O O O	happiness	165
all of which I should record in my books to hand down to posterity	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	165
but if he would give me a cow's horn	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	165
I would keep it as a trophy of the happy days I had spent in his country	O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O O O O O O O	happiness	165
He gave me one	O O O O	happiness	165
measuring 3 feet 5 inches in length	O O O O O O O	happiness	165
and 18 3/4 inches in circumference at the base.	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	165
n a minute or two afterwards	O O O O O O	surprise	166
the good young princes	O O O O	surprise	166
attracted by the sound of the gun	O O O O O O O	surprise	166
came to see what was done	O O O O O O	surprise	166
Their surprise knew no bounds	O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	166
they could scarcely believe what they saw	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	166
and then	O O	surprise	166
on recovering	O O	surprise	166
with the spirit of true gentlemen	O O O O O O	surprise	166
they seized both my hands	O O O O O	surprise	166
congratulating me on the magnitude of my success	O O O O O O O O	surprise	166
and pointed out	O O O	surprise	166
as an example of it	O O O O O	surprise	166
a bystander who showed fearful scars	O O O O O O	surprise	166
both on his abdomen and at the blade of his shoulder	O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	166
who they declared had been run through by one of these animals.	O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	166
heir surprise knew no bounds	O O O O O	happiness	167
they could scarcely believe what they saw	O O O O O O O	happiness	167

who they declared had been run through by one of these animals	O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	167
It was	O O	happiness	167
therefore	O	happiness	167
wonderful to them	B-EMO O O	happiness	167
they observed	O O	happiness	167
with what calmness I went up to such formidable beasts.	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	167
In the evening we had another row with my head men--Baraka having accused Bombay of trying to kill him with magic	O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	168
Bombay	O	disgust	168
who was so incessantly bullied by Baraka's officious attempts to form party cliques opposed to the interests of the journey	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	168
and get him turned out of the camp	O O O O O O O O	disgust	168
indiscreetly went to one of K'yengo's men	O O O O O O O	disgust	168
and asked him if he knew of any medicine that would affect the hearts of the Wanguana so as to incline them towards him	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	168
and on the sub-doctor saying Yes	O O O O O O	disgust	168
Bombay gave him some beads	O O O O O	disgust	168
and bought the medicine required	O O O O O	disgust	168
which	O	disgust	168
put into a pot of pombe	O O O O O O	disgust	168
was placed by Baraka's side.	O O O O O	disgust	168
Some other travellers from the north again informed us that they had heard of Wanguana who attempted to trade in Gani and Chopi	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	170
but were killed by the natives	O O O O O O	sadness	170
I now assured Rumanika that in two or three years he would have a greater trade with Egypt than he ever could have with Zanzibar	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	170
for when I opened the road	O O O O O O	sadness	170
all those men he heard of would swarm up here to visit him	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	170
however	O	sadness	170
only laughed at my folly in proposing to go to a place of which all I heard was merely that every stranger who went there was killed	O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	170
He began to show a disinclination to allow my going there	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	171
and though from the most friendly intention	O O O O O O O	fear	171
this view was alarming	O O O O	fear	171
for one word from him could have ruined my projects	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	171
As it was	O O O	fear	171
I feared my followers might take fright and refuse to advance with me	O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	171
I thought it good policy to talk of there being many roads leading through Africa	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	171
so that Rumanika might see he had not got	O O O O O O O O O	fear	171
as he thought	O O O	fear	171
the sole key to the interior.	O O O O O O	fear	171
Although	O	happiness	172
however	O	happiness	172
this very interesting people	O O O O	happiness	172
the Wahuma	O O	happiness	172
delight in supposing themselves to be of European origin	B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	172
they are forced to confess	O O O O O	happiness	172
on closer examination	O O O	happiness	172
that although they came in the first instance from the doubtful north	O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	172
they came latterly from the east	O O O O O O	happiness	172
as part of a powerful Wahuma tribe	O O O O O O O	happiness	172
beyond Kidi	O O	happiness	172
who excel in arms	O O O O	happiness	172
and are so fierce no Kidi people	O O O O O O O	happiness	172
terrible in war as these too are described to be	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	172
can stand against them.	O O O O	happiness	172
after ordering all the seizures to be given up to Maula on behalf of the king	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	173
and threatening to discharge any of my men who dared retain one item of the property	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	173
I shut the door of my hut to do penance for two days	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	173
giving orders that nobody but my cook Ilmas	O O O O O O O O	sadness	173
not even Bombay	O O O	sadness	173
should come near me	O O O O	sadness	173
for the king had caused my men to sin--had disgraced their red cloth--and had inflicted on me a greater insult than I could bear	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	173
I was ashamed to show my face	O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	173
Just as the door was closed	O O O O O O	sadness	173
other pages from the king brought the Whitworth rifle to be cleaned	O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	173
and demanded an admittance	O O O O	sadness	173
On Maula's return	O O O	happiness	174
I was told the king would not believe so generous a man as Bana could have sent him so few beads	O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	174
he believed most of my store must have been stolen on the road	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	174
and would ask me about that to-morrow.	O O O O O O O	happiness	174
He intimated that for the future I must fire a gun at the waiting-hut whenever I entered the palace	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	175
so that he might hear of my arrival	O O O O O O O O	fear	175
for he had been up that morning	O O O O O O O	fear	175
and would have been glad to see me	O O O O O O O O	fear	175
only the boys	O O O	fear	175
from fear of entering his cabinet	O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	175
had forged a lie	O O O O	fear	175
and deprived him of any interview with me	O O O O O O O O	fear	175
which he had long wished to get.	O O O O O O O	fear	175
In a little while I felt tired of the monotony	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	176
and wished to hang up a curtain	O O O O O O O	sadness	176
that I might lie down in privacy and sleep till the king was ready	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	176
but the officers in waiting forbade this	O O O O O O O	sadness	176
as contrary to law	O O O O	sadness	176
and left me the only alternative of walking up and down the court to kill time	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	176
spreading my umbrella against the powerful rays of the sun	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	176
A very little of that made me fidgety and impetuous	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	176
which the Waganda noticed	O O O O	sadness	176
and	O	sadness	176
from fear of the consequences	O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU	sadness	176
they began to close the gate to prevent my walking away.	O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	176
Until now I did not feel sure where the various rush-drains I had been crossing since leaving the Katonga valley all went to	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	177
but here my mind was made up	O O O O O O O	happiness	177
for I found a large volume of water going to the northwards	O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	177
I took off my clothes at the end of the bridge and jumped into the stream	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	177
which I found was twelve yards or so broad	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	177
and deeper than my height	O O O O O	happiness	177
I was delighted beyond measure at this very surprising fact	O O B-EMO O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	177
that I was indeed on the northern slopes of the continent	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	177
and had	O O	happiness	177
to all appearance	O O O	happiness	177
found one of the branches of the Nile's exit from the N'yanza.	O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	177
The first court passed	O O O O	surprise	179
I was even more surprised to find the unusual ceremonies that awaited me	O O O O B-EMO O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O	surprise	179
There courtiers of high dignity stepped forward to greet me	O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	179
dressed in the most scrupulously neat fashions	O O O O O O O	surprise	179
Men	O	surprise	179
women	O	surprise	179
bulls	O	surprise	179
dogs	O	surprise	179
and goats	O O	surprise	179
were led about by strings	O O O O O	surprise	179
cocks and hens were carried in men's arms	O O O O O O O O	surprise	179
and little pages	O O O	surprise	179
with rope-turbans	O O	surprise	179
rushed about	O O	surprise	179
conveying messages	O O	surprise	179
as if their lives depended on their swiftness	O O O O O O O O	surprise	179
every one holding his skin-cloak tightly round him lest his naked legs might by accident be shown.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	179
but Ntalo won't be done	O O O O O	disgust	180
so retorts by saying	O O O O	disgust	180
"""Sangizo"	O	disgust	180

you are a savage--a Mshezi	O O O O O	disgust	180
you come from the Mashenzi	O O O O O	disgust	180

"so hold your impudent tongue"""	O O O O O	disgust	180
--and the camp pealed with merry boisterous laughter again.	O O O O O O O O O	disgust	180
And all the men of the camp laugh together at the wretched Ntalo's defeat	O O O O O O O B-EMO O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	181

The king acknowledged the truthfulness of their story	O O O O O O O O	happiness	182
saying he had heard the same himself	O O O O O O O	happiness	182
and both Wakungu	O O O	happiness	182
as is the custom in Uganda	O O O O O O	happiness	182
thanked their lord in a very enthusiastic manner	O O O O O O B-EMO O	happiness	182
kneeling on the ground- -for no one can stand in the presence of his majesty--in an attitude of prayer	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	182

for a considerable time	O O O O	happiness	182
when	O	happiness	182
thinking they had done enough of this	O O O O O O O	happiness	182
and heated with the exertion	O O O O O	happiness	182
they threw themselves flat upon their stomachs	O O O O O O O	happiness	182
and	O	happiness	182
floundering about like fish on land	O O O O O O	happiness	182
repeated the same words over again and again	O O O O O O O O	happiness	182
and rose doing the same	O O O O O	happiness	182
with their faces covered with earth	O O O O O O	happiness	182
for majesty in Uganda is never satisfied till subjects have grovelled before it like the most abject worms.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	182
She admitted me at once	O O O O O	anger	183
when I gave her quinine	O O O O O	anger	183
on the proviso that I should stop there all day and night to repeat the dose	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	183
and tell her the reason why I did not come before	O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	183
She affected great anger at Mtesa having interfered with my servants when coming to see her--sympathised with me on the distance I had to travel--ordered a hut to be cleared for me ere night--told me to eat my breakfast in the next court--and	O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	183
rising abruptly	O O	anger	183
walked away	O O	anger	183
At noon we heard the king approaching with his drums and rattle-traps	O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	183
but I still waited on till 5 p	O O O O O O O O	anger	183

To-day the king went the round of his relations	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	184
"showing the beautiful things given him by the white man--a clear proof that he was much favoured by the ""spirits"	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	184
""" for neither his father nor any of his forefathers had been so recognised and distinguished by any ""sign"" as a rightful inheritor to the Uganda throne: an anti-Christian interpretation of omens"	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	184
as rife in these dark regions now as it was in the time of King Nebuchadnezzar	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	184
At midnight the three muskets were returned	O O O O O O O	happiness	184
and I was so pleased with the young king's promptitude and honesty	O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	184
I begged he would accept them.	O O O O O O	happiness	184
Here I heard	O O O	happiness	185
in an adjoining court	O O O O	happiness	185
the boisterous	O O	happiness	185
explosive laughs of both mother and son--royal shouts loud enough to be heard a mile off	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	185
and inform the community that their sovereigns were pleased to indulge in hilarity	O O O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	185
Immediately afterwards	O O	happiness	185
the gate between us being thrown open	O O O O O O O	happiness	185
the king	O O	happiness	185
like a very child	O O O O	happiness	185
stood before us	O O O	happiness	185
dressed for the first time	O O O O O	happiness	185
in public	O O	happiness	185
in what Europeans would call clothes.	O O O O O O	happiness	185
And when the whole story was fully narrated	O O O O O O O O	sadness	186
the matter was thought a good joke	O O O O O O O	sadness	186
After pausing a little	O O O O	sadness	186
I asked the king what ailed him	O O O O O O O	sadness	186
for I was sorry to hear he had been sick	O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	186
but instead of replying	O O O O	sadness	186
he shook his head	O O O O	sadness	186
as much as to say	O O O O O	sadness	186
I had put a very uncouth question to his majesty--and ordered some men to shoot cows.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	186
Early in the morning	O O O O	surprise	187
as I expected	O O O	surprise	187
she demanded my immediate attendance	O O O O O	surprise	187
and so the little diplomatic affair I had anticipated came on	O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	187
I began the affair by intimating that I am in bed	O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	187
and have not breakfasted	O O O O	surprise	187
So at 10 a	O O O O	surprise	187
another messenger arrives	O O O	surprise	187
to say her majesty is much surprised at my not coming	O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	187
What can such conduct mean	O O O O O	surprise	187
when she arranged everything so nicely for me after my own desire	O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	187
that she might drink her medicine properly	O O O O O O O	surprise	187
Instead of admiring this childish pastime	O O O O O O	sadness	188
which in Uganda is considered royal sport	O O O O O O O	sadness	188
I rather looked disdainful	O O O O	sadness	188
until	O	sadness	188
apparently disappointed at my indifference	O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	188
he asked what the box I had brought contained	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	188
On being told it was the medicine he desired	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	188
he asked me to draw near	O O O O O O	sadness	188
and sent his courtiers away	O O O O O	sadness	188
When only the interpreters and one confidential officer were left	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	188
besides myself	O O	sadness	188
he wished to know if I could apply the medicine without its touching the afflicted part.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	188
What can such conduct mean	O O O O O	fear	189
when she arranged everything so nicely for me after my own desire	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	189
that she might drink her medicine properly	O O O O O O O	fear	189
Still I am not up	O O O O O	fear	189
but nobody will let me rest for fear of the queen	O O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU	fear	189
so	O	fear	189
to while away the time	O O O O O	fear	189
I order Bombay to call upon her	O O O O O O O	fear	189

We reached the Cowes by torchlight at 9 p	O O O O O O O O O	surprise	190
when the king had a picnic dinner with me	O O O O O O O O O	surprise	190
turned in with his women in great comfort	O O O O O O O O	surprise	190
and sent me off to a dreary hut	O O O O O O O O	surprise	190
where I had to sleep upon a grass-strew floor	O O O O O O O O O	surprise	190
I was surprised we had to walk so far	O O B-EMO O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	190
when	O	surprise	190
by appearance	O O	surprise	190
we might have boated it from the head of the creek all the way down	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	190
but	O	surprise	190
on inquiry	O O	surprise	190
was informed of the swampy nature of the ground at the head of the creek precluded any approach to the clear water there	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	190
and hence the long overland journey	O O O O O O	surprise	190
which	O	surprise	190
though fatiguing to the unfortunate women	O O O O O O	surprise	190
who had to trot the whole way behind Mtesa's four-mile-an-hour strides	O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	190
was very amusing.	O O B-EMO	surprise	190
He stared	O O	happiness	191
and everybody stared	O O O	happiness	191
believing me to be a magician	O O O O O O	happiness	191
when the king said he would like to have pictures of the birds drawn and hung up in the palace	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	191
"""but let us go and shoot some more"	O O O O O O O O	happiness	191
for it is truly wonderful	O O O O B-EMO	happiness	191
Similar results followed	O O O	happiness	191
for the herons were continually whirling round	O O O O O O O	happiness	191
as they had their nests upon a neighbouring tree	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	191
I now asked permission to speak with him on some important matters	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	192
when he sent his women away and listened	O O O O O O O O	fear	192
I said I felt anxious about the road on which Mabruki was travelling	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	192
to which I added that I had ordered him to tell Petherick to come here or else to send property to the value of one thousand dollars	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	192
and I felt anxious because some of the queen's officers felt doubtful about Waganda being able to penetrate Kidi	O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	192
He said I need not concern myself on that score	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	192
he was much more anxious for the white men to come here than even I was	O O O O B-EMO O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	192
and he would not send my men into any danger	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	192
He then thought of adjutant-shooting with ball	O O O O O O O	sadness	193
left the court sitting	O O O O	sadness	193
desired me to follow him	O O O O O	sadness	193
and leading the way	O O O O	sadness	193
went into the interior of the palace	O O O O O O O	sadness	193
where only a few select officers were permitted to follow us	O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	193
The birds were wild	O O O O	sadness	193
and as nothing was done	O O O O O	sadness	193
I instructed him in the way to fire from his shoulder	O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	193
placing the gun in position	O O O O O	sadness	193
He was shy at first	O O O O O	sadness	193
and all the people laughed at my handling royalty like a schoolboy	O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	193
but he soon took to it very good-naturedly	O O O O O O O O	sadness	193
when I gave him my silk necktie and gold crest-ring	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	193
explaining their value	O O O	sadness	193
which he could not comprehend	O O O O O	sadness	193
and telling him we gentlemen prided ourselves on never wearing brass or copper.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	193
There was something in her manner when she said this that I did not like--it looked suspicious	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	194
and I contented myself by saying	O O O O O O	anger	194
"""No"	O	anger	194
I am a wiser doctor than any in these lands	O O O O O O O O O O	anger	194
if anybody could cure you	O O O O O	anger	194
that person is myself: and further	O O O O O O	anger	194
if I gave you a goat to sacrifice	O O O O O O O O	anger	194
God would be angry with both of us for our superstitious credulity	O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	194
"you must therefore say no more about it."""	O O O O O O O O	anger	194
So the four sang	O O O O	anger	196
each in turn	O O O	anger	196
and died in the sight of some who pitied	O O O O O O O O O	anger	196
and some who feared	O O O O	anger	196
and some who hated	O O O B-EMO	anger	196
for the sake of land and women	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	196
So the four went beyond the power of gold and gewgaw	O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	196
and were dragged in the mire around the walls and flung into the yellow waters of the river.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	196
There was no time to think	O O O O O O	fear	197
my great fear was that the devil in the cabin would kill Polly Ann	O O B-EMO O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	197
Just then I heard her calling out to me.	O O O O O O O O O	fear	197
The sun slid across the heavens and shot narrow blades of light	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	198
now through one loophole and now through another	O O O O O O O O	fear	198
until a ray slanted from the western wall and rested upon the red-and-black paint of two dead bodies in the corner	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	198
I stared with horror.	O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO	fear	198
``An' what did ye say	O O O O O	anger	200

pausing in her work	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	200
her eyes flashing with resentment	B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO	anger	200
``Did ye tell 'em they was cowards to want to settle lands	O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	200

The horse with the craning neck	O O O O O O	sadness	201
the liveried servant at the bridle	O O O O O O	sadness	201
the listless young gentleman with the shiny boots reclining on the horse-block	O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	201
and above him	O O O	sadness	201
under the portico	O O O	sadness	201
the grand lady whose laugh had  made me sad	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O	sadness	201
And I remembered	O O O	sadness	201
too	O	sadness	201
the wild	O O	sadness	201
neglected lad who had been to me as a brother	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	201
warm-hearted and generous	O O O	sadness	201

Where was he	O O O	sadness	201
``I fear that your kind efforts will be useless	O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	202

rather tartly	O O	fear	202
``Mr	O	fear	202

but was near to hanging my agent	O O O O O O O	fear	202
I flushed again	O O O	fear	203
and began by stammering	O O O O	fear	203
For I had a great fear that Major Colfax's temper would fly into bits when he heard it.	O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	203

No wonder they scorn the Congress as weak and impotent	O O O B-EMO O O O O O O	disgust	204
He lacked the supreme test of courage which was demanded on this occasion	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	205
Then he turned and walked away very slowly	O O O O O O O O	disgust	205
as though his pace might mitigate in some degree the shame of his retreat	O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU	disgust	205
The young man flung away the fence-rail	O O O O O O O	disgust	205
and	O	disgust	205
thrusting aside the overzealous among his admirers	O O O O O O O	disgust	205
he strode past me into the tavern	O O O O O O O	disgust	205
his anger still hot.	O O O O	disgust	205
``I fear that we are losing our heads	O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	206

``and I propose to you the health of the first citizen of Kentucky	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	206
Colonel George Rogers Clark.	O O O O	fear	206
``A fear that you were married	O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	207
'' he said	O O O	fear	207
with a boldness that made me blush	O O O O O O O	fear	207
As for Mademoiselle	O O O	fear	207
a color that vied with the June roses charged through her cheeks	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	207
She stooped to pick up her sewing	O O O O O O O	fear	207
but Nick was before her.	O O O O O	fear	207
``No	O	fear	208
'' I answered shortly	O O O O	fear	208
Then I realized suddenly what I had failed to grasp before	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	208
--she feared that I would pity her.	O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	208
For a while the tune held its mad pace	O O O O O O O O O	fear	209
and ended with a shriek and a snap on a high note	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	209
for Zeron had broken a string	O O O O O O	fear	209
Amid a burst of laughter from the far end of the room I saw Nick stop before an open window in which a prying Indian was framed	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	209
swing Suzanne at arm's length	O O O O O	fear	209
and bow abruptly at the brave with a grunt that startled him into life.	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO	fear	209
We lighted a candle	O O O O	fear	210
and poking around	O O O	fear	210
found the negro where he had crept into the farthest corner of a bunk with his face to the wall	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	210
And when we touched him he gave vent to a yell that was blood-curdling.	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O B-EMO	fear	210
The young lady did nothing of the kind	O O O O O O O O	surprise	211
She turned her back to us	O O O O O O	surprise	211
leaned against the tree	O O O O	surprise	211
and to my astonishment I saw her slim shoulders shaken with laughter	O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	211
At length	O O	surprise	211
very slowly	O O	surprise	211
she looked around	O O O	surprise	211
and in her face struggled curiosity and fear and merriment.	O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	211
``She is my mother	O O O O	anger	212
'' said Nick	O O O	anger	212
with a bitterness I had not thought in him	O O O O O O O O O	anger	212
``she is my mother	O O O O	anger	212

Presently the sobs ceased	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	213
and Mrs	O O	surprise	213
Temple raised her face	O O O O	surprise	213
slowly	O	surprise	213
wonderingly	B-EMO	surprise	213
as if she had not heard aright	O O O O O O O	surprise	213
And she tried gently to push the girl away.	O O O O O O O O O	surprise	213
``Liberty	O	fear	214

Hearing a noise	O B-CAU I-CAU	fear	214
he glanced nervously in the direction of the woods	O O B-EMO O O O O O O	fear	214
only to perceive his negro carrying a pail of water	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	214
``I--I was expecting some friends	O O O O O	fear	214

``Sit down	O O	fear	214

``And wasn't it me that said he could smell the divils	O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	215
'' said Terence	O O O	surprise	215
as he circled around us in a mimic war dance	O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	215
And when from the fort they saw us coming across the fields they opened the gates in astonishment	O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O B-EMO I-EMO	surprise	215
and on hearing the news gave themselves over to the wildest rejoicing	O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	215
For the backwoodsmen were children of nature	O O O O O O O	surprise	215
Bill Cowan ran for the fiddle which he had carried so carefully over the mountain	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	215
and that night we had jigs and reels on the common while the big fellow played ``Billy of the Wild Woods'' and ``Jump Juba	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	215
'' with all his might	O O O O O	surprise	215
and the pine knots threw their fitful	O O O O O O O	surprise	215
red light on the wild scenes of merriment	O O O O O O O O	surprise	215
I must have cut a queer little figure as I sat between Cowan and Tom watching the dance	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	215
for presently Colonel Clark came up to us	O O O O O O O O	surprise	215
laughing in his quiet way.	O O O O O	surprise	215
Then came the sugaring	O O O O	happiness	217
the warm days and the freezing nights when the earth stirs in her sleep and the taps drip from red sunrise to red sunset	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	217
Old and young went to the camps	O O O O O O O	happiness	217
the women and children boiling and graining	O O O O O O O	happiness	217
the squads of men posted in guards round about	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	217
And after that the days flew so quickly that it seemed as if the woods had burst suddenly into white flower	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	217
and it was spring again	O O O O O	happiness	217
And then--a joy to be long remembered --I went on a hunting trip with Tom and Cowan and three others where the Kentucky tumbles between its darkly wooded cliffs	O O B-EMO O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	217
And other wonders of that strange land I saw then for the first time: great licks	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	217
trampled down for acres by the wild herds	O O O O O O O O	happiness	217
where the salt water oozes out of the hoofprints	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	217
On the edge of one of these licks we paused and stared breathless at giant bones sticking here and there in the black mud	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	217
and great skulls of fearful beasts half-embedded	O O O O O O O	happiness	217
This was called the Big Bone Lick	O O O O O O O	happiness	217
and some travellers that went before us had made their tents with the thighs of these monsters of a past age.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	217
Then I heard a voice calling me	O O O O O O O	surprise	218
and pushing past Mrs	O O O O	surprise	218
Cowan	O	surprise	218
I ran into the cabin	O O O O O	surprise	218
Polly Ann lay on the log bedstead	O O O O O O O	surprise	218
and she turned to mine a face radiant with a happiness I had not imagined	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O B-EMO I-EMO	surprise	218
The Indians had shot at a party shelling corn at Captain Bowman's plantation	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	219
and killed two	O O O	anger	219
while the others had taken refuge in the crib	O O O O O O O O O	anger	219
Fired at from every brake	O O O O O	anger	219
James Ray had ridden to Harrodstown for succor	O O O O O O O O	anger	219
and the savages had been beaten off	O O O O O O O	anger	219
But only the foolhardy returned to their clearings now	O O O O O O O O O	anger	219
We were on the edge of another dreaded summer of siege	O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	219
the prospect of banishment from the homes we could almost see	O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	219
staring us in the face	O O O O O	anger	219
and the labors of the spring lost again	O O O O O O O O	anger	219
There was bitter talk within the gates that night	O O O O O O O O O	anger	219
and many declared angrily that Colonel Clark had abandoned us	O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	219
But I remembered what he had said	O O O O O O O	anger	219
and had faith in him.	O O O O O	anger	219
They turned	O O	happiness	220
and in an ecstasy of joy quite pitiful to see went trooping out of the gate	O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	220
But scarce could they have reached the street and we have broken ranks	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	220
when we saw them coming back again	O O O O O O O	happiness	220
the priest leading them as before	O O O O O O	happiness	220
They drew near to the spot where Clark stood	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	220
talking to the captains	O O O O	happiness	220
and halted expectantly.	O O O	happiness	220
The group stood wistful	O O O O	fear	221
fearful that their boldness had displeased	B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	221
expectant of reprimand.	O O O	fear	221
At length the cocks crowing for day proclaimed the morning	O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	222
and while yet the blue shadow of the bluff was on the town	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	222
Colonel Clark sallied out of the gate and walked abroad	O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	222
Strange it seemed that war had come to this village	B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	222
so peaceful and remote	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	222
And even stranger it seemed to me to see these Arcadian homes in the midst of the fierce wilderness.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	222
Excitement keyed us high	O O O O	surprise	223
we reached the shade	O O O O	surprise	223
plunged into it	O O O	surprise	223
and presently came out staring at the bastioned corners of a fort which rose from the centre of a clearing	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	223
It had once defended the place	O O O O O O	surprise	223
but now stood abandoned and dismantled	O O O O O O	surprise	223
Beyond it	O O	surprise	223
at the edge of the bluff	O O O O O O	surprise	223
we halted	O O	surprise	223
astonished	B-EMO	surprise	223
The sun was falling in the west	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	223
and below us was the goal for the sight of which we had suffered so much	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	223
At our feet	O O O	surprise	223
across the wooded bottom	O O O O	surprise	223
was the Kaskaskia River	O O O O	surprise	223
and beyond	O O	surprise	223
the peaceful little French village with its low houses and orchards and gardens colored by the touch of the evening light.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	223
To see the strange places of the world	O O O O O O O O	fear	224
and the stranger people	O O O O	fear	224
to become a man of wealth and influence such as Monsieur Vigo	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	224
and (I fear I loved it best) to match my brains with others at a bargain	O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O O	fear	224
--I turned it all over slowly	O O O O O O	fear	224
gravely	O	fear	224
in my boyish mind	O O O O	fear	224

Suddenly	O	fear	225
with the deftness of a panther	O O O O O O	fear	225
an Indian shot forward and lifted me high in his arms	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	225
To this day I recall my terror as I dangled in mid-air	O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	225
staring into a hideous face	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	225
By intuition I kicked him in the stomach with all my might	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	225
and with a howl of surprise and rage his fingers gripped into my flesh.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	225
On such occasions the current of time runs sluggish	O O O O O O O O O	fear	226
Thrice our muscles were startled into tenseness by the baying of a hound	O O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	226

and the dawn as far away as eternity.	O O O O O O O O	fear	226
He turned from them once more	O O O O O O	sadness	227
they went away in a dejection to wring our compassion	O O O O O B-EMO O O O O	sadness	227
and we thought the matter ended at last	O O O O O O O O	sadness	227
The sun was falling low	O O O O O	sadness	227
the people beginning to move away	O O O O O O	sadness	227
when	O	sadness	227
to the astonishment of all	B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO	sadness	227

turned his face away--down-stream.	O O O O	fear	229
He told us that a man named Maisonville	O O O O O O O O	sadness	230
with a party of Indians	O O O O O	sadness	230
was in pursuit of him	O O O O O	sadness	230
and the next piece of news he had was in the way of raising our despair a little	O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O	sadness	230
Governor Hamilton's astonishment at seeing this force here and now would be as great as his own	O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	230
Governor Hamilton had said	O O O O	sadness	230

that only a navy could take Vincennes this year.	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	230
``Davy	O	surprise	231

There was no time to think	O O O O O O	fear	232
my great fear was that the devil in the cabin would kill Polly Ann	O O B-EMO O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	232
Just then I heard her calling out to me.	O O O O O O O O O	fear	232
I flushed again	O O O	fear	233
and began by stammering	O O O O	fear	233
For I had a great fear that Major Colfax's temper would fly into bits when he heard it.	O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	233
Presently my father looked up from his book	O O O O O O O O	surprise	234
but did not rise	O O O O	surprise	234
As for me	O O O	surprise	234
I had been staring for some time in astonishment	O O O O O O O O B-EMO	surprise	234
for he was a better-looking man than I had ever seen	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	234
He wore a deerskin hunting shirt dyed black	O O O O O O O O	surprise	234
but	O	surprise	234
in place of a coonskin cap with the tail hanging down	O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	234
a hat.	O O	surprise	234
I recall a fear that my father would not fancy him	O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	235
In such cases he would give a stranger food	O O O O O O O O O	fear	235

One day I was surprised to see the wagoner riding up the path to our cabin	O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	236

for he was a violent man	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	236
And a violent scene followed.	O O O O O	fear	236
Then the moment of departure came	O O O O O O	happiness	237
Mademoiselle Marguerite acknowledged the parting remarks of the servants	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	237
who were secretly delighted to be freed from her presence	O O B-EMO I-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	237
and then	O O	happiness	237
before entering the carriage	O O O O	happiness	237
she cast a long	O O O O	happiness	237
sad look upon this princely mansion which she had once had the right to believe her own	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	237
but which she was	O O O O	happiness	237
alas	O	happiness	237
now leaving	O O	happiness	237
in all probability	O O O	happiness	237
for ever.	O O	happiness	237
The worthy housekeeper was present at this conference	O O O O O O O O	fear	238
For an instant she had feared that Mademoiselle Marguerite suspected her manoeuvres but her fears were now dispelled	O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O	fear	238
and she even congratulated herself on her skilfulness.	O O O O O O O O	fear	238
This furnished Madame de Fondege with another excuse for proffering her advice	O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	239
But Mademoiselle Marguerite would not allow herself to be convinced at once	O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	239
She raised a great many objections	O O O O O O	happiness	239
and parleyed for a long time before telling Madame de Fondege that she would be happy to accept the hospitality which had been offered her	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	239
And her consent was by no means unconditional.	O O O O O O O O	happiness	239
Fortunat's address must be there	O O O O O	happiness	240
so she asked and obtained permission to examine this note- book	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	240
and to her great joy	O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO	happiness	240
"under the letter ""F"	O O O O	happiness	240

"On the previous evening he had said to her: ""Farewell until to-morrow"	O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	241

she was extremely surprised that he had not yet put in an appearance.	O O B-EMO I-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	241
It was easy to see by Madame de Fondege's earnestness that she feared Mademoiselle Marguerite would avail herself of this opportunity of recovering her liberty	O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	242

Marguerite's only reply was a despairing gesture	O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO	sadness	243
It would have been impossible for her to articulate a syllable--her tears were choking her.	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O	sadness	243
Arrayed in his best uniform	O O O O O	fear	244
his thin legs encased in black silk stockings	O O O O O O O O	fear	244
his mantle thrown gracefully over his shoulders	O O O O O O O	fear	244
and his cocked hat under his arm	O O O O O O O	fear	244
he was looking anxiously about for some one in the assembled crowd to whom he could give the signal for departure	O O O B-EMO O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	244
He was already talking of starting off when M	O O O O O O O O O	fear	244

I must fulfil a sacred duty	O O O O O O	disgust	245

"It is the first time in my life that I was ever behind time."""	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	245
But how she revenged herself	O O O O O	sadness	246
"She was ""virtuous"	O O O	sadness	246
""" but so dangerously virtuous that one might have supposed she was so against her will"	O O O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	246

She ruled her husband with a rod of iron.	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	246
I searched under all the trees	O O O O O O	fear	247
and yet I could not find her	O O O O O O O	fear	247
It was as dark as pitch	O O O O O O	fear	247
and suddenly a terrible fear seized hold of me--such a terrible fright that I really believe I called for help	O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	247
"and I ran back to the house half crazed."""	O O O O O O O O O	fear	247
But the worthy woman had already recovered her self-possession and her accustomed loquacity at the same time	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	248
"""Ah"	O	sadness	248

it was only from the kindest of motives that I ventured into the garden	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	248

He was in all the greater haste as it was Sunday	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	249
Fortunat was in the habit of passing these days in the country	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	249

And while running to the Place de la Bourse	O O O O O O O O O	fear	249
he carefully prepared the story he meant to relate	O O O O O O O O O	fear	249
"deeply impressed by the wisdom of the popular maxim which says: ""It is not always well to tell the whole truth."""	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	249
Still it did not prevent him from trying to justify himself	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	250
although he was careful not to confess the truth	O O O O O O O O O	fear	250
for he dreaded his mother's censure	O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	250
knowing well enough that she would be less indulgent than his own conscience.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	250
However	O	anger	251
the effect of this discovery was to dispel his anger	O O O O O O O O O O	anger	251

in trying to set a name on this face	O O O O O O O O O	anger	254

He had evidently come with the intention of consulting with Sherlock Holmes	O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	371

and the mystery which was attached to it	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	382
made this organization doubly terrible	O O O B-EMO I-EMO	fear	382

considering how heshould broach the matter to his daughter	O O O O O O O O O	fear	383
when a soft hand was laid uponhis	O O O O O O O	fear	383

he saw her standing beside him	O O O O O O	fear	383

As he approached his farm	O O O O O	surprise	386
he was surprised to see a horse hitched toeach of the posts of the gate	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	386
Still more surprised was he on the entering to find two young men in possession of his sitting-room	O B-EMO I-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	386
One	O	surprise	386
with a longpale face	O O O O	surprise	386
was leaning back in the rocking-chair	O O O O O O	surprise	386
with his feet cocked upupon the stove	O O O O O O O	surprise	386
The other	O O	surprise	386
a bull-necked youth with coarse	O O O O O	surprise	386
bloatedfeatures	O	surprise	386
was standing in front of the window with his hands in hispockets whistling a popular hymn	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	386
Both of them nodded to Ferrier as heentered	O O O O O O O O	surprise	386
and the one in the rocking-chair commenced the conversation.	O O O O O O O O O	surprise	386
How this warning came into his room puzzled John Ferrier sorely	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU B-EMO O O O	disgust	387
for hisservants slept in an outhouse	O O O O O O	disgust	387
and the doors and windows had all been secured	O O O O O O O O O	disgust	387
He crumpled the paper up and said nothing to his daughter	O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	387
butthe incident struck a chill into his heart	O O O O O O O O	disgust	387
The twenty-nine days wereevidently the balance of the month which Young had promised.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	387
Still more shaken was he next morning	O O O O O O O	surprise	388
They had sat down to their breakfast	O O O O O O O	surprise	388
when Lucy with a cry of surprise pointed upwards	O O O O O O B-EMO O O	surprise	388
In the centre of the ceiling was scrawled	O O O O O O O O	surprise	388
with a burned stick apparently	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	388
the number 28	O O O	surprise	388
To his daughter it was unintelligible	O O O O O O	surprise	388
and he did not enlightenher	O O O O O	surprise	388
That night he sat up with his gun and kept watch and ward.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	388
He walked for a couple of miles through one ravine after anotherwithout [72] success	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	389
though	O	sadness	389
from the marks upon the bark of the trees	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	389
and other indications	O O O	sadness	389
he judged that there were numerous bears in thevicinity	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	389
At last	O O	sadness	389
after two or three hours   fruitless search	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O	sadness	389
he was thinking of turning back in despair	O O O O O O O B-EMO	sadness	389
when casting his eyes upwards he saw a sightwhich sent a thrill of pleasure through his heart	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	389
On the edge of a juttingpinnacle	O O O O O O	sadness	389
three or four hundred feet above him	O O O O O O O	sadness	389
there stood a creature somewhat resembling a sheep in appearance	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	389
but armed with a pair ofgigantic horns.	O O O O O O O	sadness	389
He had now come to the mouth of the very defile in which he had left  them	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	390
Even in the darkness he could recognize the outline of the cliffs which bounded it	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	390
They must	O O	fear	390
he reflected	O O	fear	390
be awaiting him anxiously	O O O B-EMO	fear	390
for he had been absent nearly five hours	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	390
In the gladness of his heart he puthis hands to his mouth and made the glen reecho to a loud halloo as asignal that he was coming	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	390
He paused and listened for an answer.	O O O O O O O	fear	390
Their faces were pale and sad	O O O O O O	fear	391
and there were tears in the eyes of some of them	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	391
What was passing in their minds	O O O O O O	fear	391
Perhaps they were overcome by that unconquerable fear which sudden and unexpected death always provokes	O O O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	391
Perhaps they unconsciously loved this master	O O O O O O	fear	391
whose bread they ate	O O O O	fear	391
Perhaps their grief was only selfishness	O O O O O O	fear	391
and they were merely wondering what would become of them	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	391
where they should find another situation	O O O O O O	fear	391
and if it would prove a good one.	O O O O O O O O	fear	391
Deeply moved by the sight of this despair	O O O O O O O B-EMO	fear	393
the servants held their breath	O O O O O	fear	393
wondering how it would all end	O O O O O O	fear	393
It ended suddenly	O O O	fear	393
The girl sprang from her knees	O O O O O O	fear	393

followed the movements of the cards	O O O O O O	sadness	420

And realizing that he must meet facts with facts	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	421
he besought God to grant him an idea	O O O O O O O O	sadness	421
an inspiration	O O	sadness	421

Such was not at all the opinion of the majority of the guests	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	422

Clients became so numerous that Pascal found it necessary to draw nearer the business centre	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	433

and their conversation abruptly ceased on his approach	O O O O O O O O	sadness	438
They assumed a grave look and turned away their heads in disgust	O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	438
The unfortunate man at once realized the truth	O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	438
and pressed his hand to his forehead	O O O O O O O	sadness	438
with a despairing gesture	O O B-EMO O	sadness	438
"as he murmured: ""Already"	O O O O	sadness	438
--already	O	sadness	438
"Pascal read as follows: ""There was great sensation and a terrible scandal last night at the residence of Madame d'A----"	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	439
a well- known star of the first magnitude	O O O O O O O O	happiness	439
A score of gentlemen of high rank and immense wealth were enjoying a quiet game of baccarat	O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	439
when it was observed that M	O O O O O O	happiness	439
F---- was winning in a most extraordinary manner	O O O O O O O O	happiness	439
He was watched and detected in the very act of dexterously slipping some cards into the pack he held.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	439
and	O	disgust	440
unfortunately	O	disgust	440
this prank cannot be attributed to a momentary fit of madness	O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	440
for the fact that he had provided himself with these cards in advance proves the act to have been premeditated	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	440
One of the persons present was especially displeased	O O O O O O O O	disgust	440
This was the Viscount de C----	O O O O O O	disgust	440
who had introduced M	O O O O	disgust	440
F---- to Madame d'A----	O O O O	disgust	440
Extremely annoyed by this contretemps	O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	440
he took umbrage at an offensive remark made by M	O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	440
de R----	O O	disgust	440
and it was rumored that these gentlemen would cross swords at daybreak this morning.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	440
He little fancied at that supreme moment that each of his gestures	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	441
each contraction of his features	O O O O O	fear	441
were viewed by the mother whose name he faltered	O O O O O O O O O	fear	441
Since her son had left her to go to the Palais de Justice	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	441
the poor woman had remained almost crazy with anxiety	O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO	fear	441
and when she heard him return and lock himself in his office--a thing he had never done before--a fearful presentiment was aroused in her mind	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	441
Gliding into her son's bedroom	O O O O O	fear	441
she at once approached the door communicating with his office.	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	441
The upper part of this portal was of glass	O O O O O O O O O	fear	442
it was possible to see what was occurring in the adjoining room	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	442
When Madame Ferailleur perceived Pascal seat himself at his desk and begin to write	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	442
she felt a trifle reassured	O O O O O	fear	442
and almost thought of going away	O O O O O O	fear	442
But a vague dread	O O O O	fear	442
stronger than reason or will	O O O O O	fear	442
riveted her to the spot	O O O O O	fear	442
A few moments later	O O O O	fear	442
when she saw the revolver in her son's hand	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	442
she understood everything	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	442
Her blood froze in her veins	O O O O O O	fear	442
and yet she had sufficient self-control to repress the cry of terror which sprang to her lips	O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O O O O O	fear	442
She realized that the danger was terrible	O O O O O O O	fear	442
imminent	O	fear	442
extreme	O	fear	442
Her heart	O O	fear	442
rather than her bewildered reason	O O O O O	fear	442
told her that her son's life hung on a single thread	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	442
The slightest sound	O O O	fear	442
a word	O O	fear	442
a rap on the door might hasten the unfortunate man's deed.	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	442
He lowered his head despondently	O O O O B-EMO	sadness	443
and in a tone of profound discouragement	O O O O O O O	sadness	443
"he replied: ""But what can I do"	O O O O O O O	sadness	443
How can I escape from the web which has been woven around me with such fiendish cunning	O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	443
If I had possessed my usual presence of mind at the moment of the accusation	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	443
I might have defended and justified myself	O O O O O O O	sadness	443
perhaps	O	sadness	443
But now the misfortune is irreparable	O O O O O O	sadness	443
How can I unmask the traitor	O O O O O O	sadness	443
and what proofs of his guilt can I cast in his face	O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	443
Pascal was absorbed in thought	O O O O O	fear	444
"""And what a strange coincidence"	O O O O O	fear	444
""" he eventually remarked"	O O O O	fear	444
"""Do you know"	O O O	fear	444
the last time I saw Marguerite	O O O O O O	fear	444
a week ago	O O O	fear	444
she seemed so sad and anxious that I felt alarmed	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	444
I questioned her	O O O	fear	444

After a little while	O O O O	fear	444
however	O	fear	444
as I insisted	O O O	fear	444

but he has recently had several long conferences in private with a young man whose father rendered him a great service in former years	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	444
And this young man	O O O O	fear	444

The baron's surprisefound vent in a positive distortion of his features	O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	445

"""ah"	O	surprise	445

""" And as no one had offered him a seat"	O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	445
he approached an arm-chair and took possession of it	O O O O O O O O O	surprise	445

"""You will allow me"	O O O O	surprise	445

So saying he noisily blew his nose	O O O O O O O	happiness	446
but this did not prevent him from observing the quiet joy of Pascal and his mother	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	446
They were amazed	O O O	happiness	446
But although these words were calculated to make them feel intensely happy	O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O B-EMO	happiness	446
they still looked at their visitor with distrust	O O O O O O O O	happiness	446

unless he has some special motive for doing so	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	446
and what could this singular man's object be	O O O O O O O O	happiness	446
Meanwhile Madame Ferailleur and her son had exchanged significant glances	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	447
Their impressions were the same	O O O O O	happiness	447
This man could not be an enemy	O O O O O O O	happiness	447
When the baron had finished his letter	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	447
and had read it aloud	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	447

The doctor was expecting something very different	O O O O O O O	sadness	449

A little ashamed of his indiscretion	O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	450
the doctor retreated seven or eight steps down the stairs	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	450

coughing slightly	O O	sadness	450

what he desired	O O O	happiness	452

The dismissal was so imperious that M	O O O O O O O	fear	499

One afternoon	O O	surprise	500
when Bruno came home from school	O O O O O O	surprise	500
he was surprised to find Maria	O O B-EMO O O O	surprise	500
the family's maid—who always kept her head bowed and never looked up from the carpet—standing in his bedroom	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	500
pulling all his belongings out of the wardrobe and packing them in four large wooden crates	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	500
even the things he'd hidden at the back that belonged to him and were nobody else's business.	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	500
'What are you doing	O O O O	sadness	501
' he asked in as polite a tone as he could muster	O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	501
for although he wasn't happy to come home and find someone going through his possessions	O O O B-EMO I-EMO O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	501
his mother had always told him that he was to treat Maria respectfully and not just imitate the Way Father spoke to her	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	501
'You take your hands off my things.'	O O O O O O O	sadness	501
Mother had walked into her own bedroom by then but Lars	O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	502
the butler	O O	sadness	502
was in there	O O O	sadness	502
packing her things too	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O	sadness	502
She sighed and threw her hands in the air in frustration before marching back to the staircase	O B-EMO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	502
followed by Bruno	O O O	sadness	502
who wasn't going to let the matter drop without an explanation.	O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	502
Bruno ran downstairs and even passed her out on the staircase so that he was waiting in the dining room when she arrived	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	503
He looked at her without saying anything for a moment and thought to himself that she couldn't have applied her make-up correctly that morning because the rims of her eyes were more red than usual	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	503
like his own after he'd been causing chaos and got into trouble and ended up crying.	O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O B-EMO	sadness	503
'What is	O O	sadness	504

'Am I being sent away	O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	504
"'	'No"	O	sadness	504
not just you	O O O	sadness	504

looking as if she might smile for a moment but thinking better of it	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	504

Bruno thought about this and frowned	O O O O O B-EMO	sadness	504
He wasn't particularly bothered if Gretel was being sent away because she was a Hopeless Case and caused nothing but trouble for him	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	504
But it seemed a little unfair that they all had to go with her.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	504

'And we all have to go too	O O O O O O O	sadness	506

'You wouldn't want Father to go to his new job on his own and be lonely there	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	506

"'	'I suppose not"	O O O	sadness	506

Father would miss us all terribly if we weren't with him	O O B-EMO O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	506
' she added.	O O O	sadness	506
Mother sighed and looked around the room as if she might never see it again	O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	507
It was a very beautiful house and had five floors in total	O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	507
if you included the basement	O O O O O	sadness	507
where Cook  made all the food and Maria and Lars sat at the table arguing with each other and calling each other names that you weren't supposed to use	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	507
And if you added in the little room at the top of the house with the slanted windows where Bruno could see right across Berlin if he stood up on his tiptoes and held onto the frame tightly.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	507
'Oh my	O O	sadness	508
' said Mother with a laugh	O O O O O O	sadness	508
although it was a strange kind of laugh because she didn't look happy and turned away from Bruno as if she didn't want him to see her face	O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	508
'Yes	O	sadness	508
Bruno	O	sadness	508
' she said	O O O	sadness	508
'It's more than a mile away	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	508
Quite a lot more than that	O O O O O O	sadness	508
in fact.'	O O	sadness	508
Bruno's eyes opened wide and his mouth  made the shape of an O	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	511
He felt his arms stretching out at his sides like they did whenever something surprised him	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	511
'You don't mean we're leaving Berlin	O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	511

gasping for air as he got the words out	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	511
'I'm afraid so	O O O	sadness	511

nodding her head sadly.	O O O B-EMO	sadness	511
'Say goodbye to them	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	513

staring at her in surprise	O O O O O	anger	513
'Say goodbye to them	O O O O	anger	513
' he repeated	O O O	anger	513
spluttering out the words as if his mouth was full of biscuits that he'd munched into tiny pieces but not actually swallowed yet	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	513
'Say goodbye to Karl and Daniel and Martin	O O O O O O O O	anger	513
' he continued	O O O	anger	513
his voice coming dangerously close to shouting	O O O O O O B-EMO	anger	513
which	O	anger	513
was not allowed indoors	O O O O	anger	513
'But they're my three best friends for life	O O O O O O O O	anger	513
'I'm sorry	O B-EMO	sadness	514

'but your plans are just going to have to wait	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	514

'Bruno	O	sadness	515

snapping at him now and standing up to show him that she was serious when she said that was enough	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	515
'Honestly	O	sadness	515
only last week you were complaining about how much things have changed here recently.'	O O O O O B-EMO O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	515
'Everyone has to do that	O O O O O	sadness	516

'It keeps us safe	O O O O	sadness	516
And who knows	O O O	sadness	516
maybe we'll be in less danger if we move away	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	516
Now	O	sadness	516
I need you to go upstairs and help Maria with your packing	O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	516
We don't have as much time to prepare as I would have liked	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	516
thanks to some people	O O O O	sadness	516
Bruno nodded and walked away sadly	O O O O O B-EMO	sadness	516
knowing that 'some people' was a grown-up's word for 'Father' and one that he wasn't supposed to use himself.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	516
When he first saw their new house Bruno's eyes opened wide	O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU O O O O	surprise	517
his mouth  made the shape of an O and his arms stretched out at his sides once again	B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	517
Everything about it seemed to be the exact opposite of their old home and he couldn't believe that they were really going to live there.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	517
But there was something about the new house that  made Bruno think that no one ever laughed there	O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O O	sadness	518
that there was nothing to laugh at and nothing to be happy about.	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	518
Bruno had a pain in his stomach and he could feel something growing inside him	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	519
something that when it worked its way up from the lowest depths inside him to the outside world would either make him shout and scream that the whole thing was wrong and unfair and a big mistake for which somebody would pay one of these days	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	519
or just make him burst into tears instead.	O O O O O O O O	anger	519
He couldn't understand how this had all come about	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	521
One day he was perfectly content	O O O O O B-EMO	happiness	521
playing at home	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	521
having three best friends for life	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	521
sliding down banisters	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	521

and now he was stuck here in this cold	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	521
nasty house with three whispering maids and a waiter who was both unhappy and angry	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	521
where no one looked as if they could ever be cheerful again.	O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	521
'Bruno	O	sadness	522

' said Mother in an unfriendly voice	O O O O O O O	sadness	522
and he knew that she meant business so he turned round and marched away without another word	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	522
He could feel tears springing up behind his eyes but he was determined that he wouldn't allow them to appear.	O O O B-EMO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	522
Just at that moment there was a creak outside in the hallway and Bruno looked up to see the door of Mother and Father's room opening slightly	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	523
He froze	O B-EMO	fear	523
unable to move for a moment	O O O O O O	fear	523
Mother was still downstairs	O O O O	fear	523
which meant that Father was in there and he might have heard everything that Bruno had just said	O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	523

hardly daring to breathe	O O O O	fear	523
wondering whether Father might come through it and take him downstairs for a serious talking-to.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	523
'One	O	fear	524
of your father's soldiers	O O O O	fear	524

who had stood up very straight when the young man appeared and held her hands before her like a person in prayer	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	524
She had stared down at the ground rather than at his face	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	524

He felt as if he was about to cry again but stopped himself	O O O O O O O O B-EMO O O O O	sadness	526
not wanting to look like a baby in front of Maria	O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	526
He looked around the room without fully lifting his eyes up from the ground	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	526
trying to see whether there was anything of interest to be found.	O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	526
'Of course I did	O O O O	happiness	529
' she replied	O O O	happiness	529
'You don't think I'd have left them at home	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	529
Why	O	happiness	529
it could be weeks before we're back there again	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	529
'Weeks	O	happiness	529
' said Bruno	O O O	happiness	529
sounding disappointed but secretly pleased because he'd resigned himself to the idea of spending a month there	O O O O B-EMO O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	529
'Do you really think so	O O O O O	happiness	529
'Of course	O O	sadness	530
' said Gretel	O O O	sadness	530
who always spoke of Father as if he could never do any wrong and never got angry and always came in to kiss her goodnight before she went to sleep which	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	530
if Bruno was to be really fair and not just sad about moving houses	O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU	sadness	530
he would have admitted Father did for him too.	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	530
'And I miss Hilda and Isobel and Louise	O O O O O O O O	anger	531
' said Gretel	O O O	anger	531
and Bruno tried to remember which of those three girls was the monster	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	531
'I don't think the other children look at all friendly	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	531
' said Bruno	O O O	anger	531
and Gretel immediately stopped putting one of her more terrifying dolls on a shelf and turned round to stare at him.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO	anger	531
There wasn't any grass after the fence	O O O O O O O	surprise	532
in fact there was no greenery anywhere to be seen in the distance	O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	532
Instead the ground was  made of a sand-like substance	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O	surprise	532
and as far as she could make out there was nothing but low huts and large square buildings dotted around and one or two smoke stacks in the distance	O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	532
She opened her mouth to say something	O O O O O O O	surprise	532
but when she did she realized that she couldn't find any words to express her surprise	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO	surprise	532
and so she did the only sensible thing she could think of and closed it again.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	532
'Look over there	O O O	happiness	534
' said Bruno	O O O	happiness	534
and Gretel followed the direction of the finger he was pointing and saw	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	534
emerging from a hut in the distance	O O O O O O O	happiness	534
a group of children huddled together and being shouted at by a group of soldiers	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	534
The more they were shouted at	O O O O O O	happiness	534
the closer they huddled together	O O O O O	happiness	534
but then one of the soldiers lunged towards them and they separated and seemed to do what he had wanted them to do all along	O O O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	534
which was to stand in a single line	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	534
When they did	O B-CAU I-CAU	happiness	534
the soldiers all started to laugh and applaud them.	O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O	happiness	534
'Look over there	O O O	sadness	535
' said Bruno	O O O	sadness	535
and Gretel followed the direction of the finger he was pointing and saw	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	535
emerging from a hut in the distance	O O O O O O O	sadness	535
a group of children huddled together and being shouted at by a group of soldiers	O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	535
The more they were shouted at	O O O O O O	sadness	535
the closer they huddled together	O O O O O	sadness	535
but then one of the soldiers lunged towards them and they separated and seemed to do what he had wanted them to do all along	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	535
which was to stand in a single line	O O O O O O O O	sadness	535
When they did	O O O	sadness	535
the soldiers all started to laugh and applaud them	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	535
'It must be some sort of rehearsal	O O O O O O O	sadness	535
' suggested Gretel	O O O	sadness	535
ignoring the fact that some of the children	O O O O O O O O	sadness	535
even some of the older ones	O O O O O O	sadness	535
even the ones as grown up as her	O O O O O O O O	sadness	535
looked as if they were crying.	O O O O O B-EMO	sadness	535
Bruno walked slowly down the stairs and hesitated for a moment outside the door	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	537
He felt sad that Father had not come up to say hello to him in the hour or so that he had been here	O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	537
but it had been explained to him on many occasions just how busy Father was and that he couldn't be disturbed by silly things like saying hello to him all the time	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	537
But the soldiers had left now and he thought it would be all right if he knocked on the door.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	537
'You were a help to your mother and sister in closing the house	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	538
' 'Yes	O O	happiness	538
Father	O	happiness	538
' said Bruno	O O O	happiness	538
'Then I'm proud of you	O O B-EMO O O	happiness	538
' said Father approvingly	O O O O	happiness	538
'Sit down	O O	happiness	538
boy.'	O	happiness	538
'What do I think	O O O O	sadness	539
' asked Bruno	O O O	sadness	539
'What do I think of what	O O O O O O	sadness	539
' 'Of your new home	O O O O O	sadness	539
Do you like it	O O O O	sadness	539
' 'No	O O	sadness	539
' said Bruno quickly	O O O O	sadness	539
because he always tried to be honest and knew that if he hesitated even for a moment then he wouldn't have the nerve to say what he really thought	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	539
'I think we should go home	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	539
' he added bravely	O O O O	sadness	539
Father's smile faded only a little and he glanced down at his letter for a moment before looking back up again	O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	539
as if he wanted to consider his reply carefully	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	539
'Well	O	sadness	539
we are home	O O O	sadness	539
Bruno	O	sadness	539
' he said finally in a gentle voice	O O O O O O O O	sadness	539
'Out-With is our new home.'	O O O O O	sadness	539
'I want to go home	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	541
' said Bruno	O O O	sadness	541
He could feel tears welling up behind his eyes and wanted nothing more than for Father to realize just how awful a place Out-With really was and agree that it was time to leave.	O O O B-EMO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	541
Bruno looked around	O O O	surprise	543
His gaze landed on the window in the corner of the room and through it he could see the awful landscape beyond	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	543
'Did you do something wrong	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	543
' he asked after a moment	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	543
'Something that  made the Fury angry	O O O O O O O	surprise	543
' 'Me	O O	surprise	543
' said Father	O O O	surprise	543
looking at him in surprise	O O O O B-EMO	surprise	543
'What do you mean	O O O O	surprise	543
'Did you do something bad in work	O O O O O O O	anger	546
I know that everyone says you're an important man and that the Fury has big things in mind for you	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	546
but he'd hardly send you to a place like this if you hadn't done something that he wanted to punish you for	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	546
Father laughed	O O	anger	546
which upset Bruno even more	O O O O O	anger	546
there was nothing that made him more angry than when a grown-up laughed at him for not knowing something	O O O O O O O B-EMO O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	546
especially when he was trying to find out the answer by asking questions.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	546
'I don't want to accept it	O O O O O O	surprise	548
' shouted Bruno	O O O	surprise	548
blinking in surprise because he hadn't known he was going to shout out loud.	O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	548
He tensed slightly and got ready to make a run for it if necessary	O B-EMO O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	549
But nothing seemed to be making Father angry today—and if Bruno was honest with himself he would have admitted that Father rarely became angry	O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	549
he became quiet and distant and always had his way in the end anyway—and rather than shouting at him or chasing him around the house	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	549
he simply shook his head and indicated that their debate was at an end.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	549
'Go to your room	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	550
Bruno	O	sadness	550
' he said in such a quiet voice that Bruno knew that he meant business now	O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	550
so he stood up	O O O O	sadness	550
tears of frustration forming in his eyes	B-EMO O O O O O O	sadness	550
He walked towards the door	O O O O O	sadness	550
but before opening it he turned round and asked one final question	O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	550
'Father	O	sadness	550
' he began.	O O O	sadness	550
'It's not about that	O O O O	sadness	552
' said Bruno quickly	O O O O	sadness	552
'I just have one other question	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	552
Father sighed but indicated that he should ask it and then that would be an end to the matter and no arguments.	O B-EMO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	552
'Everything here is horrible	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	558
' he said out loud	O O O O O	anger	558
even though there was no one present to hear him	O O O O O O O O O O	anger	558
but somehow it  made him feel better to hear the words stated anyway	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	558
'I hate this house	O O O O	anger	558
I hate my room and I even hate the paintwork	O O O O O O O O O O	anger	558
I hate it all	O B-EMO O O	anger	558
Absolutely everything.'	O O	anger	558
Gretel was nowhere to be found and he had begun to worry that he would go mad with boredom.	O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	559
'Well	O	happiness	561
of course it's important	O O O O	happiness	561
' said Bruno irritably	O O O O	happiness	561
as if she was just being deliberately difficult	O O O O O O O O	happiness	561
'You're part of the family	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	561
aren't you	O O	happiness	561
' 'I'm not sure whether your father would agree with that	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	561
' said Maria	O O O	happiness	561
allowing herself a smile because she was touched by what he had just said.	O O O O O O O B-EMO O O O O O O	happiness	561
'When I make mistakes I get punished	O O O O O O O	anger	562
' insisted Bruno	O O O	anger	562
irritated by the fact that the rules that always applied to children never seemed to apply to grownups at all (despite the fact that they were the ones who enforced them)	B-EMO O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	562
'Stupid Father	O O	anger	562
' he added under his breath.	O O O O O O	anger	562
'Stupid Father	B-CAU I-CAU	surprise	563
' he added under his breath	O O O O O O	surprise	563
Maria's eyes opened wide and she took a step towards him	O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O O O O O O O	surprise	563
her hands covering her mouth for a moment in horror	O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	563
She looked round to make sure that no one was listening to them and had heard what Bruno had just said	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	563
'You mustn't say that	O O O O	surprise	563
' she said	O O O	surprise	563
'You must never say something like that about your father.'	O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	563
'Because your father is a good man	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	565
' said Maria	O O O	happiness	565
'A very good man	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	565

' 'There are many things your father has done	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	565

'Many things of which you should be proud	O O O O O O O B-EMO	happiness	565
If it wasn't for your father	O O O O O O	happiness	565
where would I be now after all	O O O O O O O	happiness	565
'My mother knew your father when he was just a boy of your age	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	566
' said Maria after a few moments	O O O O O O O	happiness	566
'She worked for your grandmother	O O O O O	happiness	566
She was a dresser for her when she toured Germany as a younger woman	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	566
She arranged all the clothes for her concerts—washed them	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	566
ironed them	O O	happiness	566
repaired them	O O	happiness	566
Magnificent gowns	O O	happiness	566
all of them	O O O	happiness	566
And the stitching	O O O	happiness	566
Bruno	O	happiness	566
Like art work	O O O	happiness	566
every design	O O	happiness	566
You don't find dressmakers like that these days	O O O O O O O O	happiness	566
She shook her head and smiled at the memory as Bruno listened patiently	O O O O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	566
'She  made sure that they were all laid out and ready whenever your grandmother arrived in her dressing room before a show	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	566
And after your grandmother retired	O O O O O	happiness	566
of course my mother stayed friendly with her and received a small pension	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	566
but times were hard then and your father offered me a job	O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	566
the first I had ever had	O O O O O O	happiness	566
A few months later my mother became very sick and she needed a lot of hospital care and your father arranged it all	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	566
even though he was not obliged to	O O O O O O O	happiness	566
He paid for it out of his own pocket because she had been a friend to his mother	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	566
And he took me into his household for the same reason	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	566
And when she died he paid all the expenses for her funeral too	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	566
So don't you ever call your father stupid	O O O O O O O O	happiness	566
Bruno	O	happiness	566
Not around me	O O O	happiness	566
I won't allow it.'	O O O O	happiness	566
Bruno bit his lip	O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO	sadness	567
He had hoped that Maria would take his side in the campaign to get away from Out-With but he could see where her loyalties really lay	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	567
And he had to admit that he was rather proud of his father when he heard that story.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	567
Bruno recognized footsteps pounding up the stairs towards them	O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	571
quicker and quicker	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	571
and he crawled back on the bed	O O O O O O O	fear	571
pressing himself against the wall	O O O O O	fear	571
suddenly afraid of what was going to happen next	O O O O O O O O O	fear	571
He held his breath	O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO	fear	571
expecting trouble	O O	fear	571
but it was only Gretel	O O O O O	fear	571
the Hopeless Case.	O O O	fear	571
She poked her head through the doorway and seemed surprised to find her brother and the family maid engaged in conversation.	O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	572
'Because she's the maid	O O O O	anger	574

'That's what she's here for	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	574
'That's not what she's here for	O O O O O O	anger	574

standing up and marching over to her	O O O B-EMO O O O	anger	574
'She's not just here to do things for us all the time	O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	574
you know	O O	anger	574
Especially things that we can do ourselves.'	O O O O O O O	anger	574
'I still think he's  made a terrible mistake	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	575
' said Bruno quietly after a few minutes when he felt as if he wanted to apologize for his sister's behaviour but didn't know whether that was the right thing to do or not	O O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	575
Situations like that always  made Bruno feel very uncomfortable because	O O O O O O O O B-EMO O O	sadness	575
in his heart	O O O	sadness	575
he knew that there was no reason to be impolite to someone	O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	575
even if they did work for you	O O O O O O O	sadness	575
There was such a thing as manners after all.	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	575
'No	O	fear	577

her voice becoming grating now as she appealed to him	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	577
'Just keep quiet about it	O O O O O	fear	577
Bruno	O	fear	577

There was something in her eyes	O O O O O O	fear	577
a sort of frenzied worry	O O O O B-EMO	fear	577
that he had never seen there before and that unsettled him.	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	577
In the distance he could see the gate that led to the road that led to the train station that led home	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	578
but the idea of going there	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	578
the idea of running away and being left on his own without anyone at all	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	578
was even more unpleasant to him than the idea of staying.	O O O B-EMO O O O O O O O	sadness	578
Several weeks after Bruno arrived at Out-With with his family and with no prospect of a visit on the horizon from either Karl or Daniel or Martin	O O O O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	579
he decided that he'd better start to find some way to entertain himself or he would slowly go mad.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO	anger	579
Franz was one of the young men who fought for us in the trenches	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	581
Your father knew him very well back then	O O O O O O O O	fear	581
I believe they served together	O O O O O	fear	581
'And what happened to him	O O O O O	fear	581
' asked Bruno	O O O	fear	581
'It doesn't matter	O O O	fear	581

'War is not a fit subject for conversation	O O O O O O O O	fear	581

Lieutenant Kotler was deep in conversation with Gretel and whatever he was saying must have been terribly funny because she was laughing loudly and twirling her hair around her fingers into ringlets	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	585
ello	O	anger	585
' said Bruno as he approached them	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	585
and Gretel looked at him irritably	O O O O O B-EMO	anger	585
'What do you want	O O O O	anger	585
' she asked	O O O	anger	585
'I don't want anything	O O O O	anger	585

glaring at her	O O O	anger	585
'I just came over to say hello.'	O O O O O O O	anger	585
'Stop it	O O	anger	587
Kurt	O	anger	587

'Oh	O	anger	587
will you be quiet please	O O O O O	anger	587
' shouted Bruno	O O O	anger	587
staring at his sister in irritation	O O O O O B-EMO	anger	587
It was bad enough having to come out here and ask for a favour from Lieutenant Kotler	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	587
but it only  made things worse when his own sister teased him all the way through it.	O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O	anger	587
'Indeed	O	happiness	588

nodding his head wisely as if such things were only distant memories to him now	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	588
despite the fact that he was	O O O O O O	happiness	588
as Gretel had pointed out	O O O O O	happiness	588
no more than a teenager himself	O O O O O O	happiness	588
'Yes	O	happiness	588

nodding his head wisely as if such things were only distant memories to him now	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	589
despite the fact that he was	O O O O O O	surprise	589
as Gretel had pointed out	O O O O O	surprise	589
no more than a teenager himself	O O O O O O	surprise	589
'Yes	O	surprise	589

My friends and I had many happy afternoons together playing on them	O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	589
Bruno felt astonished that he could have anything in common with him (and even more surprised to learn that Lieutenant Kotler had ever had friends)	O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	589
'So what do you think	O O O O O	surprise	589
' he asked	O O O	surprise	589
'Are there any around	O O O O	surprise	589
'Well	O	surprise	593
how do you know	O O O O	surprise	593
' asked Bruno quickly	O O O O	surprise	593
growing irritable now despite the fact that this was the same man who had come out to pick him up off the ground and brought him in and taken care of him	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	593
'You're not a doctor	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	593
Pavel stopped peeling the carrots for a moment and looked across the table at Bruno	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	593
his head held low	O O O O	surprise	593
his eyes looking up	O O O O	surprise	593
as if he were wondering what to say to such a thing	O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	593
He sighed and seemed to consider it for quite a long time before saying	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	593
'Yes I am	O B-CAU I-CAU	surprise	593
Bruno stared at him in surprise	O O O O O B-EMO	surprise	593
This didn't make any sense to him	O O O O O O O	surprise	593
'But you're a waiter	O O O O	surprise	593

'And you peel the vegetables for dinner	O O O O O O O	surprise	593
How can you be a doctor too	O O O O O O O	surprise	593
Pavel turned his body slightly in their direction but didn't lift his head	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	594
'The wound has been cleaned	B-CAU I-CAU O O O	fear	594
' he said quietly	O O O O	fear	594
not answering Bruno's question	O O O O	fear	594
'There's nothing to worry about.'	O O O B-EMO O	fear	594
'Don't argue with me—go to your room	O O O O O O O	happiness	595
' she insisted	O O O	happiness	595
and Bruno stepped off the chair	O O O O O O	happiness	595
putting his weight on what he had decided to call his bad leg	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	595
and it hurt a little	O O O O O	happiness	595
He turned and left the room but was still able to hear Mother saying thank you to Pavel as he walked towards the stairs	O O O O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	595
and this  made Bruno happy because surely it was obvious to everyone that if it hadn't been for him	O O O O B-EMO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	595
he would have bled to death.	O O O O O O	happiness	595
Grandfather had spent his entire life running a restaurant in the centre of town	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	596
and one of his employees was the father of Bruno's friend Martin who worked there as a chef	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	596
Although Grandfather no longer cooked or waited on tables in the restaurant himself	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	596
he spent most of his days there	O O O O O O O	happiness	596
sitting at the bar in the afternoon talking to the customers	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	596
eating his meals there in the evening and staying until closing time	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	596
laughing with his friends.	B-EMO O O O	happiness	596
Father always stayed to listen and Bruno did too because there was nothing he liked more than hearing Grandmother break into her full voice and soak up the applause of the guests at the end	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O B-EMO O O O O O O	happiness	597
Plus	O	happiness	597
La Vie en Rose gave him chills and  made the tiny hairs on the back of his neck stand on end.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	597
Grandfather was very proud of his son when he saw him in his new uniform but Grandmother was the only one who seemed unimpressed	O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O O	sadness	600
After dinner had been served	O O O O O	sadness	600
and after she and Gretel and Bruno had performed their latest production	O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	600
she sat down sadly in one of the armchairs and looked at Father	O O O B-EMO O O O O O O O O O	sadness	600
shaking her head as if he were a huge disappointment to her.	O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	600
'He did come to harm	O O O O O	happiness	601
Matthias	O	happiness	601
' insisted Grandmother	O O O	happiness	601
'Take a look at him for your evidence	O O O O O O O O	happiness	601
'And now look at you	O O O O O	happiness	601
' continued Grandfather	O O O	happiness	601
ignoring her	O O	happiness	601
'It makes me so proud to see you elevated to such a responsible position	O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	601
Helping your country reclaim her pride after all the great wrongs that were done to her	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	601
The punishments above and beyond—''Oh	O O O O O	happiness	601
will you listen to yourself	O O O O O	happiness	601
' cried Grandmother	O O O	happiness	601
'Which one of you is the most foolish	O O O O O O O O	happiness	601
I wonder	O O	happiness	601
'That's all you soldiers are interested in anyway	O O O O O O O O	anger	603
' Grandmother said	O O O	anger	603
ignoring the children altogether	O O O O	anger	603
'Looking handsome in your fine uniforms	O O O O O O	anger	603
Dressing up and doing the terrible	O O O O O O	anger	603
terrible things you do	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	603
It makes me ashamed	O O O O	anger	603
But I blame myself	O O B-EMO O	anger	603
Ralf	O	anger	603
not you.'	O O	anger	603
Bruno hadn't seen much of Grandmother after that and hadn't even had a chance to say goodbye to her before they moved to Out-With	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	604
but he missed her very much and decided to write her a letter.	O O B-EMO O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	604
The walk along the fence took Bruno a lot longer than he expected	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	605
it seemed to stretch on and on for several miles	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	605
He walked and walked	O O O O	sadness	605
and when he looked back the house that he was living in became smaller and smaller until it vanished from sight altogether	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	605
During all this time he never saw anyone anywhere close to the fence	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	605
nor did he find any doors to let him inside	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	605
and he started to despair that his exploration was going to be entirely unsuccessful	O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	605
In fact although the fence continued as far as the eye could see	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	605
the huts and buildings and smoke stacks were disappearing in the distance behind him and the fence seemed to be separating him from nothing but open space.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	605
Shmuel thought about it and looked down at his fingers and they wiggled in the air	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	607
as if he was trying to calculate	O O O O O O O	surprise	607
'I'm nine	O O	surprise	607
' he said	O O O	surprise	607
'My birthday is April the fifteenth nineteen thirty-four	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	607
Bruno stared at him in surprise	O O O O O B-EMO	surprise	607
'What did you say	O O O O	surprise	607
' he asked	O O O	surprise	607
'I said my birthday is April the fifteenth nineteen thirty-four.'	O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	607
Bruno's eyes opened wide and his mouth  made the shape of an O	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	608
'I don't believe it	O O O O	surprise	608
' he said	O O O	surprise	608
'Why not	O O	surprise	608
' asked Shmuel	O O O	surprise	608
'No	O	surprise	608
' said Bruno	O O O	surprise	608
shaking his head quickly	O O O O	surprise	608
'I don't mean I don't believe you	O O O O O O O	surprise	608
I mean I'm surprised	O O O B-EMO	surprise	608
that's all	O O	surprise	608
Because my birthday is April the fifteenth too.	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	608
'Do you have many friends	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	609
' asked Bruno	O O O	sadness	609
cocking his head a little to the side as he waited for an answer	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	609
'Oh yes	B-CAU I-CAU	sadness	609
' said Shmuel	O O O	sadness	609
'Well	O	sadness	609
sort of	O O	sadness	609
Bruno frowned	O B-EMO	sadness	609
He had hoped that Shmuel might have said no as it would give them something else in common	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	609
' Close friends	O O O	sadness	609
' he asked.	O O O	sadness	609
'The Fury has something he wants to discuss with me	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	610
' said Father	O O O	surprise	610
who was allowed to interrupt Mother even if no one else was	O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	610
I just got a phone call this afternoon	O O O O O O O O	surprise	610
The only time he can make it is Thursday evening and he's invited himself to dinner	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	610
Mother's eyes opened wide and her mouth  made the shape of an O	O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O	surprise	610
Bruno stared at her and wondered whether this was what he looked like when he was surprised about something.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	610
An hour before the Fury was due to arrive Gretel and Bruno were brought downstairs	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	611
where they received a rare invitation into Father's office	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	611
Gretel was wearing a white dress and knee socks and her hair had been twisted into corkscrew curls	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	611
Bruno was wearing a pair of dark brown shorts	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	611
a plain white shirt and a dark brown tie	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	611
He had a new pair of shoes for the occasion and was very proud of them	O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O B-EMO O O	happiness	611
even though they were too small for him and were pinching his feet and making it difficult for him to walk	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	611
All these preparations and fine clothes seemed a little extravagant	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	611
all the same	O O O	happiness	611
because Bruno and Gretel weren't even invited to dinner	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	611
they had eaten an hour earlier.	O O O O O O	happiness	611
The woman standing beside him	O O O O O	fear	612
however	O	fear	612
was quite the most beautiful woman he had ever seen in his life	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	612
She had blonde hair and very red lips	O O O O O O O O	fear	612
and while the Fury spoke to Mother she turned and looked at Bruno and smiled	O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	612
making him go red with embarrassment.	O O O O O B-EMO	fear	612
The matter was resolved quickly	O O O O O	fear	613
however	O	fear	613
as the Fury	O B-CAU I-CAU	fear	613
who was the rudest guest Bruno had ever witnessed	O O O O O O O O O	fear	613
turned round and walked directly into the dining room and promptly sat down at the head of the table—in Father's seat	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	613
—without another word	O B-CAU I-CAU	fear	613
A little flustered	O O B-EMO	fear	613
Mother and Father followed him inside and Mother gave instructions to Lars that he could start heating up the soup.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	613
'We wore the armbands for a few months	O O O O O O O O	happiness	615
' he said	O O O	happiness	615
'And then things changed again	O O O O O	happiness	615
I came home one day and Mama said we couldn't live in our house any more—' 'That happened to me too	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	615

delighted that he wasn't the only boy who'd been forced to move.	B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	615
'We lived there for some more months	O O O O O O O	disgust	617
' continued Shmuel	O O O	disgust	617
'all of us in that one room	O O O O O O O	disgust	617
There was one small window in it but I didn't like to look out of it because then I would see the wall and I hated the wall because our real home was on the other side of it	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	617
And this part of town was the bad part because it was always noisy and it was impossible to sleep	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	617
And I hated Luka	O O B-EMO O	disgust	617
who was the boy who kept hitting me even when I did nothing wrong.'	O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	617
Bruno was about to leave when the food caught his eye and a question came into his mind that had been bothering him for some time	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	618
He hadn't been able to think of anyone to ask before	O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	618
but this seemed like a perfect moment and the perfect person	O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	618
'Maria	O	surprise	618

'can I ask you a question	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	618

'He said he was a doctor	O O O O O O	happiness	619

'Which didn't seem right at all	O O O O O O	happiness	619

'Why did he lie to me then	O O O O O O O	happiness	619
It doesn't make any sense.'	O O O O O	happiness	619
Later that evening Bruno was disappointed to find that Lieutenant Kotler was joining him	O O O O O B-EMO O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	620
Mother	O	sadness	620
Father and Gretel for dinner	O O O B-CAU I-CAU	sadness	620
Pavel was wearing his white jacket as usual and served them as they ate.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	620
'Herr Liszt won't let us read poetry or plays	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	621

As they had company for dinner	O O O O O O	sadness	621
the family were dressed formally—Father in his uniform	O O O O O O O O	sadness	621
Mother in a green dress that set off her eyes	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	621
and Gretel and Bruno in the clothes they wore to church when they lived in Berlin	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	621
'I asked him if we could read them just one day a week but he said no	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	621

'I enjoyed history very much when I was a boy	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	622

'And although my father was a professor of literature at the university	O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	622

turning to look at him for a moment	O O O O O O O O	sadness	622
'Does he still teach then	O O O O O	sadness	622
' 'I suppose so	O O O O	sadness	622
' said Lieutenant Kotler	O O O O	sadness	622
'I don't really know	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	622
'Well	O	sadness	622
how could you not know	O O O O O	sadness	622

frowning at him	B-EMO O O	sadness	622
'Don't you keep in touch with him	O O O O O O O	sadness	622
'I asked you where he went	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	623
' he repeated	O O O	fear	623
'Your father	O O	fear	623
The professor of literature	O O O O	fear	623
Where did he go when he left Germany	O O O O O O O O	fear	623
' Lieutenant Kotler's face grew a little red and he stuttered somewhat as he spoke	O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O O O O	fear	623
I believe… I believe he is currently in Switzerland	O O O O O O O O O	fear	623
' he said finally	O O O O	fear	623
'The last I heard he was teaching at a university in Berne.'	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	623
Bruno watched him	O O O	anger	625
hoping he was feeling all right	O O O O O O	anger	625
although he managed to release the cork without any accidents	O O O O O O O O O O	anger	625
But after he had filled Father's glass and turned to refill Lieutenant Kotler's	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	625
he lost his grip of the bottle somehow and it fell crashing	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	625
glug-glug-glugging its contents out directly onto the young man's lap	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	625
What happened then was both unexpected and extremely unpleasant	O O O O O O O O O	anger	625
Lieutenant Kotler grew very angry with Pavel and no one—not Bruno	O O O O B-EMO O O O O O O	anger	625
not Gretel	O O	anger	625
not Mother and not even Father—stepped in to stop him doing what he did next	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	625
even though none of them could watch	O O O O O O O	anger	625
Even though it  made Bruno cry and Gretel grow pale.	O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	625
'I'm reading	O O	anger	627
' said Bruno	O O O	anger	627
'What are you reading	O O O O	anger	627
' she asked him	O O O O	anger	627
and rather than answer he simply turned the cover towards her so she could see for herself	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	627
She  made a raspberry sound through her lips and some of her spit landed on Bruno's face	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	627
'Boring	B-CAU	anger	627
' she said in a sing-song voice	O O O O O O O	anger	627
'It's not boring at all	O O O O O	anger	627
' said Bruno	O O O	anger	627
'It's an adventure	O O O	anger	627
It's better than dolls	O O O O	anger	627
that's for sure	O O O	anger	627
Gretel didn't rise to the bait on that one	O O O O O O O O O	anger	627
'What are you doing	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	627
' she repeated	O B-CAU I-CAU	anger	627
irritating Bruno even further	O O O O	anger	627
I told you	O O O	anger	627

'If some people would just let me.'	O O O O O O O	anger	627
'I hate the rain too	O O O O O	anger	629

'I should be with Shmuel by now	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	629
He'll think I've forgotten him	O O O O O	anger	629
The words were out of his mouth quicker than he could stop them and he felt a pain in his stomach and grew furious with himself for saying that.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O O O O O	anger	629
'Who did you say you should be with	O O O O O O O O	anger	630

leaning forward so there could be no mistake this time	O O O O O O O O O O	anger	630
'I never said I should be with anyone	O O O O O O O O	anger	630
' he said	O O O	anger	630
'Yes	O	anger	630

'Pardon	B-CAU	anger	630
' 'Bruno	O O	anger	630

He thought of the time he had forgotten to lock the bathroom door and Grandmother had walked in and seen everything	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	632
He thought of the time he had put his hand up in class and called the teacher 'Mother' and everyone had laughed at him	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	632
He thought of the time he'd fallen off his bicycle in front of a group of girls when he was trying to do a special trick and cut his knee and cried.

Bruno smiled because he knew two things	O B-EMO O O O O O	happiness	633
The first was that he had got away with his lie and the second was that if anyone was the Hopeless Case around here	O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	633

Bruno got to the end of his sentence and realized that his voice had gone very quiet	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	637
These were things that Shmuel had told him	O O O O O O O O	sadness	637
but for some reason he hadn't really understood at the time how sad that must have  made his friend	O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O O O O O O O	sadness	637
When Bruno said them out loud himself he felt terrible that he hadn't tried to say anything to cheer Shmuel up and instead had started talking about something silly	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	637

'you're probably right	O O O	happiness	639

Bruno gasped	O B-EMO	happiness	639
'Do you have one	O O O O	happiness	639

picturing her at another part of the fence	O O O O O O O O	happiness	639
talking to a girl her own age	O O O O O O O	happiness	639
the two of them being sarcastic together for hours at a time.	O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	639
For several weeks the rain was on and off and on and off and Bruno and Shmuel did not see as much of each other as they would have liked	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	640
When they did meet Bruno found that he was starting to worry about his friend because he seemed to be getting even thinner by the day and his face was growing more and more grey.	O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	640
Seething with anger	O O O	surprise	642
Bruno went into the kitchen and got the biggest surprise of his life	O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O O O	surprise	642
There	O	surprise	642
sitting at the table	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	642
a long way from the other side of the fence	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	642
was Shmuel	B-CAU I-CAU	surprise	642
Bruno could barely believe his eyes.	O O O O O O	surprise	642
Shmuel looked up and his terrified face broke into a broad smile when he saw his friend standing there	O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	643
'Bruno	O	fear	643
' he said.	O O O	fear	643
'I'm very glad you're here	O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU	happiness	645
' he said	O O O	happiness	645
speaking with his mouth full	O O O O O	happiness	645
'If only you didn't have to polish the glasses	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	645
I could show you my room	O O O O O O	happiness	645
'He told me not to move from this seat or there'd be trouble.'	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	645
Shmuel looked as if he wasn't really listening	O O O O O O O O	sadness	646
instead his eyes were focused on the slices of chicken and stuffing that Bruno was throwing casually into his mouth	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	646
After a moment Bruno realized what he was looking at and immediately felt guilty	O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO	sadness	646
I'm sorry	O O	sadness	646
Shmuel	O	sadness	646
' he said quickly	O O O O	sadness	646
'I should have given you some chicken too	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	646
Are you hungry	O O O	sadness	646
'No	O	sadness	647
if he comes back—' said Shmuel	O O O O O O	sadness	647
shaking his head quickly and looking back and forth towards the door	O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	647
'If who comes back	O O O O	sadness	647
You don't mean Lieutenant Kotler	O O O O O	sadness	647
' 'I'm just supposed to be cleaning the glasses	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	647

looking at the bowl of water in front of him in despair and then looking back at the slices of chicken that Bruno held out to him.	O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	647
'He's not going to mind	O O O O O	sadness	649
' said Bruno	O O O	sadness	649
who was confused by how anxious Shmuel seemed	O O O O O O O O	sadness	649
'It's only food	O O O	sadness	649
'I can't	O O	sadness	649
' said Shmuel	O O O	sadness	649
shaking his head and looking as if he was going to cry	O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO	sadness	649
'He'll come back	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	649
I know he will	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	649

his sentences running quickly together	O O O O O	sadness	649
'I should have eaten them when you offered them	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	649

'Shmuel	O	happiness	650
Here	O	happiness	650
' said Bruno	O O O	happiness	650
stepping forward and putting the slices in his friend's hand	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	650
'Just eat them	O O O	happiness	650
There's lots left for our tea—you don't have to worry about that	O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	650
The boy stared at the food in his hand for a moment and then looked up at Bruno with wide and grateful but terrified eyes	O O O O O B-CAU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O O O	happiness	650
He threw one more glance in the direction of the door and then seemed to make a decision	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	650
because he thrust all three slices into his mouth in one go and gobbled them down in twenty seconds flat.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	650
'You have been eating	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	651
' insisted Lieutenant Kotler	O O O O	anger	651
'Did you steal something from that fridge	O O O O O O O	anger	651
' Shmuel opened his mouth and closed it	O O O O O O O O	anger	651
He opened it again and tried to find words	O O O O O O O O O	anger	651
but there were none	O O O O	anger	651
He looked towards Bruno	O O O O	anger	651
his eyes pleading for help	O O O O O	anger	651
'Answer me	O O	anger	651
' shouted Lieutenant Kotler	O B-EMO O O	anger	651
'Did you steal something from that fridge	O O O O O O O	anger	651
Bruno hadn't seen his grandmother since leaving Berlin but he had thought about her every day	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	655
The things he remembered most about her were the productions that she and he and Gretel performed at Christmas and birthdays and how she always had the perfect costume to suit whatever role he played	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	655
When he thought that they would never be able to do that again it  made him very sad indeed.	O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O B-EMO O O	sadness	655
The two days they spent in Berlin were also very sad ones	O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	656
There was the funeral	O O O O	sadness	656
and Bruno and Gretel and Father and Mother and Grandfather sat in the front row	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	656
Father wearing his most impressive uniform	O O O O O O	sadness	656
the starched and pressed one with the decorations	O O O O O O O O	sadness	656
Father was particularly sad	O O O B-EMO	sadness	656
Mother told Bruno	O O O	sadness	656
because he had fought with Grandmother and they hadn't  made it up before she died.	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O	sadness	656
There were a lot of wreaths delivered to the church and Father was proud of the fact that one of them had been sent by the Fury	O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	657
but when Mother heard she said that Grandmother would turn in her grave if she knew it was there.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	657
There was also the fact that Lieutenant Kotler had been transferred away from Out-With and wasn't around to make Bruno feel angry and upset all the time	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	658
(His departure had come about very suddenly and there had been a lot of shouting between Father and Mother about it late at night	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	658
but he was gone	O O O O	happiness	658
that was for sure	O O O O	happiness	658
and he wasn't coming back	O O O O O	happiness	658
Gretel was inconsolable	O O O	happiness	658
That was something else to be happy about: no one called him 'little man' any more.	O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	658
He enjoyed walking along the fence every afternoon and was pleased to see that his friend seemed a lot happier these days and his eyes didn't seem so sunken	O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	659
although his body was still ridiculously skinny and his face unpleasantly grey.	O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	659
'No	O	happiness	660
' said Bruno	O O O	happiness	660
'I don't understand why we're not allowed on the other side of it	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	660
What's so wrong with us that we can't go over there and play	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	660
' Gretel stared at him and then suddenly started laughing	O O O O O O O O O B-EMO	happiness	660
only stopping when she saw that Bruno was being perfectly serious.	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	660
'We're the opposite	O O O	happiness	661
' said Gretel	O O O	happiness	661
answering quickly and sounding a lot more satisfied with this answer	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	661
'Yes	O	happiness	661
that's it	O O	happiness	661
We're the opposite	O O O	happiness	661
'All right	O O	happiness	661
' said Bruno	O O O	happiness	661
pleased that he had it settled in his head at last	B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	661
'And the Opposite live on this side of the fence and the Jews live on that.'	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	661
It turned out that both Gretel and Bruno had lice in their hair	O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	663
and Gretel had to be treated with a special shampoo that smelled horrible and afterwards she sat in her room for hours on end	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	663
crying her eyes out.	B-EMO O O O	sadness	663
Bruno had the shampoo as well	O O O O O O	sadness	664
but then Father decided that the best thing was for him to start afresh and he got a razor and shaved all Bruno's hair off	O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	664
which  made Bruno cry	O O O B-EMO O	sadness	664
It didn't take long and he hated seeing all his hair float down from his head and land on the floor at his feet	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	664
but Father said it had to be done.	O O O O O O O O	sadness	664
When he saw his friend the next day Shmuel started to laugh at Bruno's appearance	O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	667
which didn't do a lot for his dwindling self-confidence	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	667
'I look just like you now	O O O O O O	sadness	667
' said Bruno sadly	O O O B-EMO	sadness	667
as if this was a terrible thing to admit.	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	667
Over the course of the next few weeks Mother seemed increasingly unhappy with life at Out-With and Bruno understood perfectly well why that might be	O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	668
After all	O O	happiness	668
when they'd first arrived he had hated it	O O O O O O O O	happiness	668
due to the fact that it was nothing like home and lacked such things as three best friends for life	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	668

But Mother didn't have a Shmuel of her own	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	668

Next morning Camaralzaman woke up before the bird left its perch	O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	741
and no sooner did it take flight than he followed it again with as little success as the previous day	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	741
only stopping to eat some herbs and fruit he found by the way	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	741
In this fashion he spent ten days	O O O O O O O	sadness	741
following the bird all day and spending the night at the foot of a tree	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	741
whilst it roosted on the topmost bough	O O O O O O O	sadness	741
On the eleventh day the bird and the prince reached a large town	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	741
and as soon as they were close to its walls the bird took a sudden and higher flight and was shortly completely out of sight	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	741
whilst Camaralzaman felt in despair at having to give up all hopes of ever recovering the talisman of the Princess Badoura.	O O O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	741
On first waking she was much surprised not to find the prince near her	O O O O O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	742
She called her women and asked if they knew where he was	O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	742
and whilst they were telling her that they had seen him enter the tent	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	742
but had not noticed his leaving it	O O O O O O O	surprise	742
she took up her belt and perceived that the little pouch was open and the talisman gone.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	742
She at once concluded that her husband had taken it and would shortly bring it back	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	744
She waited for him till evening rather impatiently	O O O O O O O O	fear	744
and wondering what could have kept him from her so long	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	744
When night came without him she felt in despair and abused the talisman and its maker roundly	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	744
In spite of her grief and anxiety however	O O O O O O B-EMO O	fear	744
she did not lose her presence of mind	O O O O O O O O	fear	744
but decided on a courageous	O O O O O	fear	744
though very unusual step.	O O O O	fear	744
The prince	O O	surprise	745
who had watched the whole scene with much interest	O O O O O O O O O	surprise	745
now drew near the spot where it happened	O O O O O O O O	surprise	745
and glancing at the dead bird he noticed something red lying near which had evidently fallen out of its inside	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	745
He picked it up	O O O O	surprise	745
and what was his surprise when he recognised the Princess Badoura's talisman which had been the cause of many misfortunes	O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	745
It would be impossible to describe his joy	O O O O O O O O	surprise	745
he kissed the talisman repeatedly	O O O O O	surprise	745
wrapped it up	O O O	surprise	745
and carefully tied it round his arm	O O O O O O O	surprise	745
For the first time since his separation from the princess he had a good night	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	745
and next morning he was up at day-break and went cheerfully to ask what work he should do.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	745
He then led the gardener to the cave	O O O O O O O O	happiness	746
and having shown him the treasure stored up there	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	746
said how happy it made him that Heaven should in this way reward his kind host's many virtues and compensate him for the privations of many years.	O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	746
It may well be believed that the prince felt in despair at this fresh misfortune	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	747
which obliged him to spend another year in a strange and distasteful country	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	747
Moreover	O	fear	747
he had once more lost the Princess Badoura's talisman	O O O O O O O O O	fear	747
which he feared he might never see again	O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	747
There was nothing left for him but to hire the garden as the old man had done	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	747
and to live on in the cottage	O O O O O O O	fear	747
As he could not well cultivate the garden by himself	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	747
he engaged a lad to help him	O O O O O O O	fear	747
and to secure the rest of the treasure he put the remaining gold dust into fifty more jars	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	747
filling them up with olives so as to have them ready for transport.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	747

Next day the prince seized a favourable opportunity for making his request	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	754

he put his gold into a long and narrow purse	O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	757

I then brought him back disguised	O O O O O O	fear	758

to my house	O O O	fear	758

For two months I hunted thus	O O O O O O	fear	759

an elephant	O O	fear	759

One morning as I watched the coming of the elephants I was surprised to see that	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	759
instead of passing the tree I was in	O O O O O O O O	fear	759
as they usually did	O O O O	fear	759
they paused	O O	fear	759
and completely surrounded it	O O O O	fear	759
trumpeting horribly	O O	fear	759

I was terrified	O B-EMO I-EMO	fear	759

I had indeed good reason for my terror when	O O O O O O O O O	fear	759
an instant later	O O O	fear	759
the largest of the animals wound his trunk round the stem of my tree	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	759
and with one mighty effort tore it up by the roots	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	759
bringing me to the ground entangled in its branches	O O O O O O O O O	fear	759
I thought now that my last hour was surely come	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	759
but the huge creature	O O O O	fear	759
picking me up gently enough	O O O O O	fear	759
set me upon its back	O O O O O	fear	759
where I clung more dead than alive	O O O O O O O	fear	759
and followed by the whole herd turned and crashed off into the dense forest	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	759
It seemed to me a long time before I was once more set upon my feet by the elephant	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	759

Then	O	fear	759
recovering myself	O O	fear	759
I looked about me	O O O O	fear	759

and I feared I should never see you again	O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	760
"Pray tell me how you escaped death."""	O O O O O O O	fear	760
So saying he struck him several hard blows	O O O O O O O O	fear	761
The corpse fell on the floor	O O O O O O	fear	761
but the man only redoubled his blows	O O O O O O O	fear	761
till at length it occurred to him it was odd that the thief should lie so still and make no resistance	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	761
Then	O	fear	761
finding he was quite dead	O O O O O	fear	761
a cold fear took possession of him	O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	761
"""Wretch that I am"	O O O O	fear	761
""" said he"	O O O	fear	761
"""I have murdered a man"	O O O O O	fear	761
Ah	O	fear	761
my revenge has gone too far	O O O O O O	fear	761
Without tho help of Allah I am undone	O O O O O O O O	fear	761
Cursed be the goods which have led me to my ruin	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	761
And already he felt the rope round his neck.	O O O O O O O O O	fear	761
In this same island we saw the rhinoceros	O O O O O O O O	fear	762
an animal which is smaller than the elephant and larger than the buffalo	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	762
It has one horn about a cubit long which is solid	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	762
but has a furrow from the base to the tip	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	762
Upon it is traced in white lines the figure of a man	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	762
The rhinoceros fights with the elephant	O O O O O O	fear	762
and transfixing him with his horn carries him off upon his head	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	762
but becoming blinded with the blood of his enemy	O O O O O O O O O	fear	762
he falls helpless to the ground	O O O O O O	fear	762
and then comes the roc	O O O O O	fear	762
and clutches them both up in his talons and takes them to feed his young	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	762
This doubtless astonishes you	O O O O	fear	762
but if you do not believe my tale go to Rohat and see for yourself	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	762
For fear of wearying you I pass over in silence many other wonderful things which we saw in this island	O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	762
Before we left I exchanged one of my diamonds for much goodly merchandise by which I profited greatly on our homeward way	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	762
At last we reached Balsora	O O O O O	fear	762
whence I hastened to Bagdad	O O O O O	fear	762
where my first action was to bestow large sums of money upon the poor	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	762
after which I settled down to enjoy tranquilly the riches I had gained with so much toil and pain.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	762
At this I was greatly surprised	O O O O O B-EMO	surprise	763
but looking carefully at him I recognised him to be the captain of the ship upon which I had made my second voyage	O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	763
though he had altered much since that time	O O O O O O O O	surprise	763
As for him	O O O	surprise	763
believing me to be dead it was no wonder that he had not recognised me.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	763
At daylight we wandered inland	O O O O O	fear	764
and soon saw some huts	O O O O O	fear	764
to which we directed our steps	O O O O O O	fear	764
As we drew near their black inhabitants swarmed out in great numbers and surrounded us	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	764
and we were led to their houses	O O O O O O O	fear	764
and as it were divided among our captors	O O O O O O O O	fear	764
I with five others was taken into a hut	O O O O O O O O O	fear	764
where we were made to sit upon the ground	O O O O O O O O O	fear	764
and certain herbs were given to us	O O O O O O O	fear	764
which the blacks made signs to us to eat	O O O O O O O O O	fear	764
Observing that they themselves did not touch them	O O O O O O O O	fear	764
I was careful only to pretend to taste my portion	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	764
but my companions	O O O	fear	764
being very hungry	O O O	fear	764
rashly ate up all that was set before them	O O O O O O O O O	fear	764
and very soon I had the horror of seeing them become perfectly mad	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	764
Though they chattered incessantly I could not understand a word they said	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	764
nor did they heed when I spoke to them	O O O O O O O O O	fear	764
The savages now produced large bowls full of rice prepared with cocoanut oil	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	764
of which my crazy comrades ate eagerly	O O O O O O O	fear	764
but I only tasted a few grains	O O O O O O O	fear	764
understanding clearly that the object of our captors was to fatten us speedily for their own eating	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	764
and this was exactly what happened	O O O O O O	fear	764
My unlucky companions having lost their reason	O O O O O O O	fear	764
felt neither anxiety nor fear	O O O O O	fear	764
and ate greedily all that was offered them	O O O O O O O O	fear	764
So they were soon fat and there was an end of them	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	764
but I grew leaner day by day	O O O O O O O	fear	764
for I ate but little	O O O O O	fear	764
and even that little did me no good by reason of my fear of what lay before me	O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	764
However	O	fear	764
as I was so far from being a tempting morsel	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	764
I was allowed to wander about freely	O O O O O O O	fear	764
and one day	O O O	fear	764
when all the blacks had gone off upon some expedition leaving only an old man to guard me	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	764
I managed to escape from him and plunged into the forest	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	764
running faster the more he cried to me to come back	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	764
until I had completely distanced him.	O O O O O O	fear	764
Hindbad was not a little surprised at this summons	O O O O O O O O O	fear	765
and feared that his unguarded words might have drawn upon him the displeasure of Sindbad	O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	765
so he tried to excuse himself upon the pretext that he could not leave the burden which had been entrusted to him in the street	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	765
However the lackey promised him that it should be taken care of	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	765
and urged him to obey the call so pressingly that at last the porter was obliged to yield.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	765
From time to time we landed at various islands	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	766
where we sold or exchanged our merchandise	O O O O O O O	sadness	766
and one day	O O O	sadness	766
when the wind dropped suddenly	O O O O O	sadness	766
we found ourselves becalmed close to a small island like a green meadow	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	766
which only rose slightly above the surface of the water	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	766
Our sails were furled	O O O O	sadness	766
and the captain gave permission to all who wished to land for a while and amuse themselves	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	766
I was among the number	O O O O O	sadness	766
but when after strolling about for some time we lighted a fire and sat down to enjoy the repast which we had brought with us	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	766
we were startled by a sudden and violent trembling of the island	O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	766
while at the same moment those left upon the ship set up an outcry bidding us come on board for our lives	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	766
since what we had taken for an island was nothing but the back of a sleeping whale	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	766
Those who were nearest to the boat threw themselves into it	O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	766
others sprang into the sea	O O O O O	sadness	766
but before I could save myself the whale plunged suddenly into the depths of the ocean	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	766
leaving me clinging to a piece of the wood which we had brought to make our fire	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	766
Meanwhile a breeze had sprung up	O O O O O O	sadness	766
and in the confusion that ensued on board our vessel in hoisting the sails and taking up those who were in the boat and clinging to its sides	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	766
no one missed me and I was left at the mercy of the waves	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	766
All that day I floated up and down	O O O O O O O O	sadness	766
now beaten this way	O O O O	sadness	766
now that	O O	sadness	766
and when night fell I despaired for my life	O O O O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	766
but	O	sadness	766
weary and spent as I was	O O O O O O	sadness	766
I clung to my frail support	O O O O O O	sadness	766
and great was my joy when the morning light showed me that I had drifted against an island.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	766
How long I slept I know not	O O O O O O O	sadness	767
but when I opened my eyes and started to my feet I perceived with horror that I was alone and that the ship was gone	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	767
I rushed to and fro like one distracted	O O O O O O O O	sadness	767
uttering cries of despair	O O O B-EMO	sadness	767
and when from the shore I saw the vessel under full sail just disappearing upon the horizon	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	767
I wished bitterly enough that I had been content to stay at home in safety	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	767
But since wishes could do me no good	O O O O O O O O	sadness	767
I presently took courage and looked about me for a means of escape	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	767
When I had climbed a tall tree I first of all directed my anxious glances towards the sea	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	767
but	O	sadness	767
finding nothing hopeful there	O O O O	sadness	767
I turned landward	O O O	sadness	767
and my curiosity was excited by a huge dazzling white object	O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	767
so far off that I could not make out what it might be.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	767
Persecuted by ill-fortune	O O O	sadness	768
and stricken with grief	O O O B-EMO	sadness	768
there seemed to be only one means of safety left to me	O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	768
I shaved my beard and my eyebrows	O O O O O O O	sadness	768
and put on the dress of a calender	O O O O O O O O	sadness	768
in which it was easy for me to travel without being known	O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	768
I avoided the towns till I reached the kingdom of the famous and powerful Caliph	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	768
Haroun-al-Raschid	O	sadness	768
when I had no further reason to fear my enemies	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	768
It was my intention to come to Bagdad and to throw myself at the feet of his Highness	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	768
who would	O O	sadness	768
I felt certain	O O O	sadness	768
be touched by my sad story	O O O O O O	sadness	768
and would grant me	O O O O	sadness	768

One after another the merchants set down a few lines upon the roll	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	771
and when they had all finished	O O O O O O	surprise	771
I came forward	O O O	surprise	771
and snatched the paper from the man who held it	O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	771
At first they all thought I was going to throw it into the sea	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	771
but they were quieted when they saw I held it with great care	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	771
and great was their surprise when I made signs that I too wished to write something.	O O O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	771
At this awful sight I shrieked aloud in my grief and pain	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	773
I threw myself on the ground and rent my clothes and tore my hair with sorrow	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	773
Then	O	fear	773
fearing to be punished as his murderer by the unhappy father	B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	773
I raised the great stone which blocked the staircase	O O O O O O O O O	fear	773
and quitting the underground chamber	O O O O O	fear	773
made everything fast as before.	O O O O O	fear	773
Whilst she was crying the grand-vizir came in and asked if the fish were ready	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	775
She told him all that had happened	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	775
and he was much surprised	O O O O B-EMO	surprise	775
He sent at once for the fisherman	O O O O O O O	surprise	775

The porter looked about him	O O O O O	fear	776
noticing and admiring everything	O O O O	fear	776
but his attention was specially attracted by a third lady sitting on the throne	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	776
who was even more beautiful than the other two	O O O O O O O O O	fear	776
By the respect shown to her by the others	O O O O O O O O O	fear	776
he judged that she must be the eldest	O O O O O O O O	fear	776
and in this he was right	O O O O O O	fear	776
This lady's name was Zobeida	O O O O O	fear	776
the porteress was Sadie	O O O O	fear	776
and the housekeeper was Amina	O O O O O	fear	776
At a word from Zobeida	O O O O O	fear	776
Sadie and Amina took the basket from the porter	O O O O O O O O O	fear	776
who was glad enough to be relieved from its weight	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	776

paid him handsomely for its use	O O O O O O	fear	776

the man still lingered	O O O O	fear	776

if you will pardon my saying so	O O O O O O O	fear	776
I was lost in astonishment at seeing such beautiful ladies by themselves	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	776
A company of women without men is	O O O O O O O	fear	776
however	O	fear	776
as dull as a company of men without women	O O O O O O O O O	fear	776
And after telling some stories to prove his point	O O O O O O O O O	fear	776

April 28	O O	surprise	811
- At the office	O O O O	surprise	811
the new and very young clerk Pitt	O O O O O O O	surprise	811
who was very impudent to me a week or so ago	O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	811
was late again	O O O	surprise	811
I told him it would be my duty to inform Mr	O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	811
Perkupp	O	surprise	811
the principal	O O	surprise	811
To my surprise	O O B-EMO	surprise	811
Pitt apologised most humbly and in a most gentlemanly fashion	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	811
I was unfeignedly pleased to notice this improvement in his manner towards me	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	811
and told him I would look over his unpunctuality	O O O O O O O O O	surprise	811
Passing down the room an hour later	O O O O O O O	surprise	811
I received a smart smack in the face from a rolled-up ball of hard foolscap	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	811
I turned round sharply	O O O O	surprise	811
but all the clerks were apparently riveted to their work	O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	811
I am not a rich man	O O O O O O	surprise	811
but I would give half-a-sovereign to know whether that was thrown by accident or design	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	811
Went home early and bought some more enamel paint - black this time - and spent the evening touching up the fender	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	811
picture-frames	O	surprise	811
and an old pair of boots	O O O O O O	surprise	811
making them look as good as new	O O O O O O O	surprise	811
Also painted Gowing's walking-stick	O O O O	surprise	811
which he left behind	O O O O	surprise	811
and made it look like ebony.	O O O O O O	surprise	811
The last time it was the greengrocer's boy	O O O O O O O O	anger	812
who	O	anger	812
not seeing it was me	O O O O O	anger	812
for Sarah had not lighted the gas	O O O O O O O	anger	812
pushed into my hands two cabbages and half-a-dozen coal-blocks	O O O O O O O O O	anger	812
I indignantly threw them on the ground	O O O O O O O	anger	812
and felt so annoyed that I so far forgot myself as to box the boy's ears	O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	812

and said he should summons me	O O O O O O	anger	812
a thing I would not have happen for the world	O O O O O O O O O O	anger	812
In the dark	O O O	anger	812
I stepped on a piece of the cabbage	O O O O O O O O	anger	812
which brought me down on the flags all of a heap	O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	812
For a moment I was stunned	O O O O O O	anger	812
but when I recovered I crawled upstairs into the drawing-room and on looking into the chimney-glass discovered that my chin was bleeding	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	812
my shirt smeared with the coal-blocks	O O O O O O	anger	812

July 31	O O	fear	813
- Carrie was very pleased with the bangle	O O O O O O O O	fear	813
which I left with an affectionate note on her dressing-table last night before going to bed	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	813
I told Carrie we should have to start for our holiday next Saturday	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	813
She replied quite happily that she did not mind	O O O O O O O O O	fear	813
except that the weather was so bad	O O O O O O O	fear	813
and she feared that Miss Jibbons would not be able to get her a seaside dress in time	O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	813
I told Carrie that I thought the drab one with pink bows looked quite good enough	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	813
and Carrie said she should not think of wearing it	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	813
I was about to discuss the matter	O O O O O O O	fear	813
when	O	fear	813
remembering the argument yesterday	O O O O	fear	813
resolved to hold my tongue.	O O O O O	fear	813
After Gowing left	O O O	surprise	815
Lupin came in	O O O	surprise	815
and in his anxiety to please Daisy Mutlar	O O O O O O O O	surprise	815
carped at and criticised the arrangements	O O O O O O	surprise	815
and	O	surprise	815
in fact	O O	surprise	815
disapproved of everything	O O O	surprise	815
including our having asked our old friend Cummings	O O O O O O O O	surprise	815
who	O	surprise	815
he said	O O	surprise	815
would look in evening-dress like a green-grocer engaged to wait	O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	815
and who must not be surprised if Daisy took him for one.	O O O O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	815
fter Gowing left	O O O	fear	816
Lupin came in	O O O	fear	816
and in his anxiety to please Daisy Mutlar	O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	816
carped at and criticised the arrangements	O O O O O O	fear	816
and	O	fear	816
in fact	O O	fear	816
disapproved of everything	O O O	fear	816
including our having asked our old friend Cummings	O O O O O O O O	fear	816

and who must not be surprised if Daisy took him for one.	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	816
At ten o'clock we went down to supper	O O O O O O O O	fear	817
and from the way Gowing and Cummings ate you would have thought they had not had a meal for a month	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	817
I told Carrie to keep something back in case Mr	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	817
Perkupp should come by mere chance	O O O O O O	fear	817
Gowing annoyed me very much by filling a large tumbler of champagne	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	817
and drinking it straight off	O O O O O	fear	817
He repeated this action	O O O O	fear	817
and made me fear our half-dozen of champagne would not last out	O O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	817
I tried to keep a bottle back	O O O O O O O	fear	817
but Lupin got hold of it	O O O O O O	fear	817
and took it to the side-table with Daisy and Frank Mutlar.	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	817
When he went	O O O	surprise	818
he said	O O	surprise	818
"to our surprise:  ""I will come to-morrow and bring my Irving make-up"	O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O	surprise	818
Gowing and Cummings said they would like to see it and would come too	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	818
I could not help thinking they might as well give a party at my house while they are about it	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	818
However	O	surprise	818
"as Carrie sensibly said:  ""Do anything"	O O O O O O O	surprise	818
dear	O	surprise	818
"to make Lupin forget the Daisy Mutlar business."""	O O O O O O O O	surprise	818
Lupin	O	surprise	819
to my surprise	O O B-EMO	surprise	819
"said:  ""Oh yes"	O O O O	surprise	819
He showed me the letter before he sent it	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	819
I think he is right	O O O O O	surprise	819
"and you ought to apologise."""	O O O O O	surprise	819
Another thought that strikes me is that Gowing seldom calls in the evening	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	821
and Cummings never does	O O O O	fear	821
I fear they don't get on well with Lupin.	O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	821
January 4	O O	surprise	822
- Mr Perkupp sent for me and told me that my position would be that of one of the senior clerks	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	822
I was more than overjoyed	O O O O B-EMO	surprise	822
Mr Perkupp added	O O O	surprise	822
he would let me know to-morrow what the salary would be	O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	822
This means another day's anxiety	O O O O O	surprise	822
I don't mind	O O O	surprise	822
for it is anxiety of the right sort	O O O O O O O O	surprise	822
That reminded me that I had forgotten to speak to Lupin about the letter I received from Mr Mutlar	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	822
senr	O	surprise	822
I broached the subject to Lupin in the evening	O O O O O O O O O	surprise	822
having first consulted Carrie	O O O O	surprise	822
Lupin was riveted to the FINANCIAL NEWS	O O O O O O O	surprise	822
as if he had been a born capitalist	O O O O O O O O	surprise	822
"and I said:  ""Pardon me a moment"	O O O O O O O O	surprise	822
Lupin	O	surprise	822
how is it you have not been to the Mutlars' any day this week	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	822
After our little supper	O O O O	fear	823
"he said:  ""My dear parents"	O O O O O O	fear	823
I have some news	O O O O	fear	823
which I fear will affect you considerably	O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	823
"""  I felt a qualm come over me"	O O O O O O O O O	fear	823
and said nothing	O O O	fear	823
"Lupin then said:  ""It may distress you - in fact"	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	823
I'm sure it will - but this afternoon I have given up my pony and trap for ever	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	823
It may seem absurd	O O O O	fear	823
but I was so pleased	O O O O O	fear	823
I immediately opened a bottle of port	O O O O O O O	fear	823
Gowing dropped in just in time	O O O O O O	fear	823
bringing with him a large sheet	O O O O O O	fear	823
with a print of a tailless donkey	O O O O O O O	fear	823
which he fastened against the wall	O O O O O O	fear	823
He then produced several separate tails	O O O O O O	fear	823
and we spent the remainder of the evening trying blindfolded to pin a tail on in the proper place	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	823
My sides positively ached with laughter when I went to bed.	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	823
In the evening Lupin arrived home early	O O O O O O O	surprise	824
and seemed a little agitated	O O O O O	surprise	824
"I said:  ""What's up"	O O O O O	surprise	824
my boy	O O	surprise	824
"""  He hesitated a good deal"	O O O O O O O	surprise	824
"and then said:  ""You know those Parachikka Chlorates I advised you to invest 20 pounds in"	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	824
"I replied:  ""Yes"	O O O O	surprise	824

His bank was the Third National of Philadelphia	O O O O O O O O	fear	825
located in that center of all Philadelphia and indeed	O O O O O O O O O	fear	825
at that time	O O O	fear	825
of practically all national finance--Third Street--and its owners conducted a brokerage business as a side line	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	825
There was a perfect plague of State banks	O O O O O O O O	fear	825
great and small	O O O	fear	825
in those days	O O O	fear	825
issuing notes practically without regulation upon insecure and unknown assets and failing and suspending with astonishing rapidity	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	825
and a knowledge of all these was an important requirement of Mr Cowperwood's position	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	825
As a result	O O O	fear	825
he had become the soul of caution	O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO	fear	825
Unfortunately	O	fear	825
for him	O O	fear	825
he lacked in a great measure the two things that are necessary for distinction in any field--magnetism and vision	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	825
He was not destined to be a great financier	O O O O O O O O O	fear	825
though he was marked out to be a moderately successful one	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	825
About a year later	O O O O	sadness	830
Mr Semple died	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	830
It was an untimely death	O O O O O	sadness	830
one of those fortuitous and in a way insignificant episodes which are	O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	830
nevertheless	O	sadness	830
dramatic in a dull way to those most concerned	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	830
He was seized with a cold in the chest late in the fall--one of those seizures ordinarily attributed to wet feet or to going out on a damp day without an overcoat--and had insisted on going to business when Mrs	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	830
Semple urged him to stay at home and recuperate	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	830
He was in his way a very determined person	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	830
not obstreperously so	O O O	sadness	830
but quietly and under the surface	O O O O O O	sadness	830
Business was a great urge	O O O O O	sadness	830
He saw himself soon to be worth about fifty thousand dollars	O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	830
Then this cold--nine more days of pneumonia--and he was dead	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	830
The shoe store was closed for a few days	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	830
the house was full of sympathetic friends and church people	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	830
There was a funeral	O O O O	sadness	830
with burial service in the Callowhill Presbyterian Church	O O O O O O O O	sadness	830
to which they belonged	O O O O	sadness	830
and then he was buried	O O O O O	sadness	830
Mrs	O	sadness	830
Semple cried bitterly	O O O	sadness	830
The shock of death affected her greatly and left her for a time in a depressed state	O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	830
A brother of hers	O O O O	sadness	830
David Wiggin	O O	sadness	830
undertook for the time being to run the shoe business for her	O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	830
There was no will	O O O O	sadness	830
but in the final adjustment	O O O O O	sadness	830
which included the sale of the shoe business	O O O O O O O O	sadness	830
there being no desire on anybody's part to contest her right to all the property	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	830
she received over eighteen thousand dollars	O O O O O O	sadness	830
She continued to reside in the Front Street house	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	830
and was considered a charming and interesting widow.	O O O O O O O O	sadness	830
Meanwhile he called on Mrs	O O O O O	happiness	832
Semple	O	happiness	832
and the more he called the better he liked her	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	832
There was no exchange of brilliant ideas between them	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	832
but he had a way of being comforting and social when he wished	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	832
He advised her about her business affairs in so intelligent a way that even her relatives approved of it	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	832
She came to like him	O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O	happiness	832
because he was so considerate	O O O O O	happiness	832
quiet	O	happiness	832
reassuring	O	happiness	832
and so ready to explain over and over until everything was quite plain to her	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	832
She could see that he was looking on her affairs quite as if they were his own	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	832
trying to make them safe and secure.	O O O O O O O	happiness	832
It was while he was calling on her in this way that his Uncle Seneca died in Cuba and left him fifteen thousand dollars	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	833
This money made him worth nearly twenty-five thousand dollars in his own right	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	833
and he knew exactly what to do with it	O O O O O O O O O	fear	833
A panic had come since Mr Semple had died	O B-EMO O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	833
which had illustrated to him very clearly what an uncertain thing the brokerage business was	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	833
There was really a severe business depression.	O O O O O O O	fear	833
Next day I joined Grant once more	O O O O O O O	fear	834
and found he had collected a few Sorombo men	O O O O O O O O O	fear	834
hoping to follow after me	O O O O O	fear	834
I then told him all my mishaps in Sorombo	O O O O O O O O O	fear	834
"as well as of the ""blue-devil"" frights that had seized all my men"	O O O O O O B-EMO O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	834
I felt greatly alarmed about the prospects of the expedition	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	834
scarcely knowing what I should do	O O O O O O	fear	834
I resolved at last	O O O O	fear	834
if everything else failed	O O O O	fear	834
to make up a raft at the southern end of the N'yanza	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	834
and try to go up to the Nile in that way.	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	834
These separations from Grant were most annoying	O O O O O O O	fear	835
but they could not be helped	O O O O O O	fear	835
so	O	fear	835
when all was settled here	O O O O O	fear	835
I bade him adieu-- both of us saying we would do our best--and set out on my journey	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	835
thinking what a terrible thing it was I could not prevail on my men to view things as I did	O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	835
Neither my experience with native chiefs	O O O O O O	fear	835
nor my money and guns	O O O O O	fear	835
were of any use to me	O O O O O O	fear	835
simply because my men were such incomprehensible fools	O O O O O O O O	fear	835
though many of them who had travelled before ought to have known better.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	835
When within a few miles of the palace we were ordered to stop and wait for Kachuchu's return	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	836
but no sooner put up in a plaintain grove	O O O O O O O O O	fear	836
where pombe was brewing	O O O O	fear	836
and our men were all taking a suck at it	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	836
than the worthy arrived to call us on the same instant	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	836
as the king was most anxious to see us	O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU	fear	836
The love of good beer of course made our men all too tired to march again	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	836
More reports came to us about Suwarora	O O O O O O O	sadness	837
all of the most inviting nature	O O O O O O	sadness	837
but nothing else worth mentioning occurred until we reached the border of Msalala	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	837
where an officer of M'yonga's	O O O O O	sadness	837
who said he was a bigger man than his chief	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	837
demanded a tax	O O O	sadness	837
which I refused	O O O	sadness	837
and the dispute ended in his snatching Nasib's gun out of his hands	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	837
I thought little of this affair myself	O O O O O O O	sadness	837
beyond regretting the delay which it might occasion	O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	837
as M'yonga	O O	sadness	837
I knew	O O	sadness	837
would not permit such usage	O O O O O	sadness	837
if I chose to go round by his palace and make a complaint	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	837
Both Bui and Nasib	O O O O	sadness	837
however	O	sadness	837
were so greatly alarmed	O O O O	sadness	837
that before I could say a word they got the gun back again by paying four yards merikani.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	837
Lumeresi	O	disgust	838
on hearing this	O O O	disgust	838
first consulted me	O O O	disgust	838
saying his chief was displeased with him	O O O O B-EMO O O	disgust	838
accusing him of being too proud	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	838
in having at once two such distinguished guests	O O O O O O O O	disgust	838
and meant by these acts only to humble him	O O O O O O O O O	disgust	838
I replied	O O	disgust	838
if that was the case	O O O O O	disgust	838
the sooner he allowed us to go	O O O O O O O	disgust	838
the better it would be for him	O O O O O O O	disgust	838
and	O	disgust	838
reminding him of his original promise to give me assistance on to Usui	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	838
said he could do so now with a very good grace.	O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	838
His badges of office he had tied on his head	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	839
the butt of a shell	O O O O O	happiness	839
representing the officer's badge	O O O O	happiness	839
being fixed on the forehead	O O O O O	happiness	839
whilst a small sheep's horn	O O O O O	happiness	839
fixed jauntily over the temple	O O O O O	happiness	839
denoted that he was a magician	O O O O O O	happiness	839
Wishing to try my powers in magical arts	O O O O O O O O	happiness	839
as I laughed at his church	O O O O O O	happiness	839
he begged me to produce an everlasting spring of water by simply scratching the ground	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	839
however	O	happiness	839
drew short up	O O O	happiness	839
to the intense delight of my men	O O O B-EMO O O O	happiness	839
on my promising that I would do so if he made one first.	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	839
This night one was shot	O O O O O	happiness	840
without any mistake about it	O O O O O	happiness	840
for the next morning we tracked him by his blood	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	840
and afterwards heard he had died of his wound	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	840
The Wasui elders	O O O	happiness	840
contrary to my expectation	O O O O	happiness	840
then came and congratulated us on our success	O O O O O O O O	happiness	840
They thought us most wonderful men	O O O O B-EMO O	happiness	840
and possessed of supernatural powers	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	840
for the thief in question was a magician	O O O O O O O O	happiness	840
who until now was thought to be invulnerable	O O O O O O O O	happiness	840
Indeed	O	happiness	840
they said Arabs with enormous caravans had often been plundered by these people	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	840
but though they had so many more guns than ourselves	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	840
they never succeeded in killing one.	O O O O O O	happiness	840
Nasib then returned to inform us that the king had heard our complaint	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	841
and was sorry for it	O O B-EMO O O	sadness	841
but said he could not interfere with the rights of his officers	O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	841
He did not wish himself to take anything from us	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	841
and hoped we would come on to him as soon as we had satisfied his officers with the trifle they wanted	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	841
Virembo then sent us some pombe by his officers	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	841
and begged us to have patience	O O O O O O	sadness	841
for he was then fleecing Masudi at the encamping-ground near the palace.	O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	841
Early in the morning we were on foot again	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	842
only too thankful to have got off so cheaply	O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	842
Then men were appointed as guides and protectors	O O O O O O O O	happiness	842
to look after us as far as the border	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	842
What an honour	O O O	happiness	842
We had come into the country drawn there by a combination of pride and avarice and now we were leaving it in hot haste under the guidance of an escort of officers	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	842
who were in reality appointed to watch us as dangerous wizards and objects of terror.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	842
Whilst Baraka's arguments all rested the other way	O O O O O O O O	disgust	843
-- that no one could tell what was ahead of him--Bana had sold himself to luck and the devil--but though he did not care for his own safety	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	843
he ought not to sacrifice the lives of others--Bombay and his lot were fools for their pains in trusting to him.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	843
At his invitation we now crossed over the spur to the Ingezi Kagera side	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	844
when	O	surprise	844
to surprise me	O B-EMO O	surprise	844
the canoes I had come up the lake in appeared before us	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	844
They had gone out of the lake at its northern end	O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	844
paddled into	O O	surprise	844
and then up the Kagera to where we stood	O O O O O O O O O	surprise	844
showing	O	surprise	844
by actual navigation	O O O	surprise	844
the connection of these highland lakes with the rivers which drain the various spurs of the Mountains of the Moon.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	844
A man from Ruanda then told us of the Wilyanwantu (men-eaters)	O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	845
who disdained all food but human flesh	O O O O O O O	disgust	845
and Rumanika confirmed the statement	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	845
Though I felt very sceptical about it	O O O O B-EMO O O	disgust	845
I could not help thinking it a curious coincidence that the position they were said to occupy agreed with Petherick's Nyam Nyams (men-eaters).	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	845
We then went into a discourse on astrology	O O O O O O O O	disgust	846
when the intelligent Rumanika asked me if the same sun we saw one day appeared again	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	846
or whether fresh suns came every day	O O O O O O O	disgust	846
and whether or not the moon made different faces	O O O O O O O O O	disgust	846
to laugh at us mortals on earth.	O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	846
Next day	O O	happiness	847
after crossing more of those abominable rush-drains	O O O O O O O	happiness	847
whilst in sight of the Victoria N'yanza	O O O O O O O	happiness	847
we ascended the most beautiful hills	O O O O B-EMO O	happiness	847
covered with verdure of all descriptions	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	847
At Meruka	O O	happiness	847
where I put up	O O O O	happiness	847
there resided some grandees	O O O O	happiness	847
the chief of whom was the king's aunt	O O O O O O O O	happiness	847
She sent me a goat	O O O O O	happiness	847
a hen	O O	happiness	847
a basket of eggs	O O O O	happiness	847
and some plantains	O O O	happiness	847
in return for which I sent her a wire and some beads.	O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	847
No one knew of a lake to supply the waters	O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	848
nor where they came from	O O O O O	surprise	848
That they flowed into the lake there was no doubt--as I could see by the trickling waters in some few places--and they lay exactly on the equator	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	848
Rising out of the valley	O O O O O	surprise	848
I found all the country just as hilly as before	O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	848
but many of the rush-drains going to northward	O O O O O O O O	surprise	848
and in the dells were such magnificent trees	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	848
they quite took me by surprise	O O O O O B-EMO	surprise	848
Clean-trunked	O	surprise	848
they towered up just as so many great pillars	O O O O O O O O O	surprise	848
and then spread out their high branches like a canopy over us	O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	848
I thought of the blue gums of Australia	O O O O O O O O	surprise	848
and believed these would beat them.	O O O O O O	surprise	848
I then (16th) very much wished to go and see the escape of the Mwerango river	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	849
as I still felt a little sceptical as to its origin	O O O O O O B-EMO O O O O	disgust	849
whether or not it came off those smaller lakes I had seen on the road the day before I crossed the river	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	849
but no one would listen to my project	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	849
They all said I must have the king's sanction first	O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	849
else people	O O	disgust	849
from not knowing my object	O O O O O	disgust	849
would accuse me of practising witchcraft	O O O O O O	disgust	849
and would tell their king so	O O O O O O	disgust	849
They still all maintained that the river did come out of the lake	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	849
and said	O O	disgust	849
if I liked to ask the king's leave to visit the spot	O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	849
then they would go and show it me.	O O O O O O O O	disgust	849
The day was now gone	O O O O O	fear	850
so torches were lit	O O O O	fear	850
and we were ordered to go	O O O O O O	fear	850
though as yet I had not been able to speak one word I wished to impart about Petherick and Grant	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	850
for my interpreters were so afraid of the king they dared not open their mouths until they were spoken to	O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	850
The king was now rising to go	O O O O O O O	fear	850
when	O	fear	850
in great fear and anxiety that the day would be lost	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	850
I said	O O	fear	850
in Kisuahili	O O	fear	850
"""I wish you would send a letter by post to Grant"	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	850
and also send a boat up the Kitangule	O O O O O O O O	fear	850
as far as Rumanika's palace	O O O O O	fear	850
for him	O O	fear	850
"for he is totally unable to walk."""	O O O O O O O	fear	850
The pages dreaded their master's wrath	O O O O O O	sadness	851
departed for a while	O O O O	sadness	851
and then sent another lad to tell me he was sorry to hear I felt unwell	O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	851
but he hoped I would come if only for a minute	O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	851
bringing my medicines with me	O O O O O	sadness	851
for he himself felt pain	O O O O O	sadness	851
That this second message was a forged one I had no doubt	O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	851
for the boys had not been long enough gone	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	851
still	O	sadness	851
I packed up my medicines and went	O O O O O O O	sadness	851
leaving the onus	O O O	sadness	851
should any accident happen	O O O O	sadness	851
upon the mischievous story- bearers.	O O O O O	sadness	851
I then sent Bombay to see the queen	O O O O O O O O	fear	852
to ask after her health	O O O O O	fear	852
beg for a hut in the palace enclosures	O O O O O O O O	fear	852
and say I should have gone myself	O O O O O O O	fear	852
only I feared her gate might be shut	O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	852
and I cannot go backwards and forwards so far in the sun without a horse or an elephant to ride upon	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	852
She begged I would come next morning.	O O O O O O O	fear	852
5th	O	sadness	853
Alarmed at having got involved in something that looked like court intrigues	O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	853
I called up N'yamgundu	O O O O	sadness	853
told him all that happened yesterday	O O O O O O	sadness	853
both at the two courts and with Maula at home	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	853
and begged him to apply to the king for a meeting of five elders	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	853
that a proper understanding might be arrived at	O O O O O O O O	sadness	853
but instead of doing as I desired	O O O O O O O	sadness	853
he got into a terrible fright	O O O O B-EMO O	sadness	853
calling Maula	O O	sadness	853
and told me if I pressed the matter in this way men would lose their lives	O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	853
Meanwhile the cunning blackguard Maula begged for pardon	O O O O O O O O	sadness	853
said I quite misunderstood his meaning	O O O O O O	sadness	853
all he had said was that I was very fortunate	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	853
being in such favour at court	O O O O O O	sadness	853
for the king and queen both equally loved me.	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	853
These Wakungu	O O	sadness	854
having only just then returned from plundering Unyoro	O O O O O O O O	sadness	854
had never before seen their king in a chair	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	854
or anybody sitting	O O O	sadness	854
as I was	O O O	sadness	854
by his side	O O O	sadness	854
and it being foreign to their notions	O O O O O O O	sadness	854
as well as	O O O	sadness	854
perhaps	O	sadness	854
unpleasant to their feelings	O O O O	sadness	854
to find a stranger sitting higher than themselves	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	854
they complained against this outrage to custom	O B-EMO O O O O O	sadness	854
and induced the king to order my dethronement	O O O O O O O O	sadness	854
The result was	O O O	sadness	854
as my iron stool was objectionable	O O O O O O	sadness	854
I stood for a moment to see that I thoroughly understood their meaning	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	854
and then showing them my back	O O O O O O	sadness	854
walked straightway home to make a grass throne	O O O O O O O O	sadness	854
and dodge them that way.	O O O O O	sadness	854
This double failure was a more serious affair then a mere slight	O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	855
for my cows were eaten up	O O O O O O	sadness	855
and my men clamouring incessantly for food	O O O O O O O	sadness	855
"and though they might by orders help themselves ""ku n'yangania""--by seizing--from the Waganda"	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O	sadness	855
it hurt my feelings so much to witness this	O B-EMO O O O O O O O	sadness	855
that I tried from the first to dispense with it	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	855
telling the king I had always flogged my men for stealing	O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	855
and now he turned them into a pack of thieves.	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	855
Fortunat made no reply	O O O O	sadness	856
de Valorsay's gayety	O O O	sadness	856
instead of cheering	O O O	sadness	856
saddened him	B-EMO O	sadness	856
"""Ah"	O	sadness	856
my fine fellow	O O O	sadness	856

"""you would sing a different song if you knew that by this time M de Chalusse is probably dead"	O O O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	856
and that most likely Mademoiselle Marguerite has only her beautiful eyes left her	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	856
"and will dim them in weeping for her vanished millions."""	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	856
Possibly it was because she did not know where Pascal was going	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	858
Possibly M de Coralth was the cause of herstrange disquietude	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O B-EMO	fear	858
for she utterly disliked the viscount	O O O O O O	fear	858
Her woman's instinct warned her that there was something unwholesome about this young man's peculiar handsomeness	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	858
and that it was not safe to trust to his professions of friendship.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	858
"""I was stupefied and alarmed by the sudden terror which M de Chalusse had displayed and could not control"	O O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	859
What could it all mean	O O O O O	fear	859
What sorrowful recollections	O O O	fear	859
what mysterious apprehensions	O O O	fear	859
had my words aroused in the count's mind	O O O O O O O O	fear	859
I could not understand or imagine why he should regard my question as strange or unnatural	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	859
On the contrary	O O O	fear	859
I thought it perfectly natural	O O O O O	fear	859
dictated as it had been by circumstances	O O O O O O O	fear	859
and by the count's own words and manner.	O O O O O O O O	fear	859
Fortunat left the restaurant	O O O O	fear	860
almost on the run	O O O O	fear	860
for he feared that he might be pursued and overtaken by M Casimir	O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	860
But after he had gone a couple of hundred paces	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	860
he paused	O O	fear	860
not so much to take breath	O O O O O O	fear	860
as to collect his scattered wits	O O O O O O	fear	860
and though the weather was cold	O O O O O O	fear	860
he seated himself on a bench to reflect.	O O O O O O O O	fear	860
He would later bristle whenever anyone referred to Paul and Clara Jobs as his adoptive parents or implied that they were not his real parents.	O O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	864
Then a more disconcerting discovery began to dawn on him: He was smarter than his parents.	O O O B-EMO O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	865
Anne the kitchen-maid scoured the pans	O O O O O O	happiness	866
her bony frame seemed to rattle as she scrubbed with her red hands	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	866
she was happy because she was hungry and there would be a beef-steak pudding for dinner	O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	866

In part because she had always been so reserved a child	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	894
in part because there had been no one in whom she might confide even had she wished it	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	894
she had always placed an intensity of feeling around and about the few things that were hers	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	894
Her library was very small	O O O O O	happiness	894
but this did not distress her because she had never cared for reading	O O O B-EMO I-EMO O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	894

The rest of the interview came to her only dimly	O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	898
She knew that Uncle Mathew was still upon his feet protesting	O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	898

through the kitchen garden at the back of the village	O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	900
down the hill by the village street	O O O O O O O	surprise	900
over the little bridge that crossed the rocky stream of the Dreot	O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	900

The day	O O	surprise	900

the warmth of the sun	O O O O O	surprise	900
seen so dimly that it was like a shadow reflected in a mirror	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	900
struck to the very heart of the soil.	O O O O O O O O	surprise	900
Her first thought as she went forward was disgust at her own weakness	O O O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	901
once again she had been betrayed by her feelings	O O O O O O O O O	fear	901

When at last she found herself	O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	902

standing upon the vast platform under the high black dome	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	902
the noise and confusion excited and delighted her	O O O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O	happiness	902
She rose to the waves of sound as a swimmer rises in the sea	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	902
her heart beat fast	O O O O	happiness	902
and she was so eagerly engaged in looking about her	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	902

His voice was of an extreme kindliness and his eyes	O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	923
when she looked up at him	O O O O O O	surprise	923

He was perfectly simple	O O O O	surprise	923

Her fear was of Martin	O O O O O	fear	927

He remembered the fat short cook with the pink cotton dress who wheezed and blew so when she had to climb the stairs.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	933
Then when at last she had mounted the vehicle she would flood the conductor with a stream of little questions	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	936

striking her nearest neighbour's eye or nose with her umbrella	O O O O O O O O O O	anger	936

because she thought she had been too forward with a stranger	O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	936
staring fiercely about her and daring any one to speak to her.	O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	936
Her attitude was one of surprised excitement	O O O O O O O	surprise	937
She was amazed by the most ordinary incidents and conversations	O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	937
She found Maggie's life quite incredible.	O O O O O O	surprise	937
She had been trained in another school from Caroline	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	938
she felt from the very first that upon certain questions her lovely friend was inexperienced	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	938
foolish and dangerously reckless	O O O O	sadness	938
"On the question of ""men"	O O O O O	sadness	938

Maggie	O	sadness	938

refused to follow Caroline's light and easy excursions	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	938
Caroline was disappointed	O O B-EMO	sadness	938

she assured Maggie	O O O	sadness	938
"from a vast variety of experience: ""Men are all the same."	O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	938

expect any more.	O O O	happiness	939
I realised that by nine out of every ten men and five out of every ten women the literary page in the paper is turned over with exactly the same impatience with which I turn over the betting columns	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	941

perfectly right	O O	sadness	941
And then by this time I'd seen my old books	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	941

lying scattered amongst dusty piles in second- hand shops marked	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	941

The young man was apparently in love with a lady much older than himself	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	942
who wore pince-nez	O O O	surprise	942

however	O	happiness	944
about Mr	O O	happiness	944
Magnus was that he did not mind when you disliked his work	O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	944
He seemed to expect that you would not like it	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	944

I couldn't imagine what they were all about	O O O O O O O O	happiness	945
it wasn't the ordinary London congregation	O O O O O O	happiness	945
it was almost the ordinary London service and yet not quite	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	945
there was an air of expectation and even excitement which is most unusual in a London church	O O O O O O O O B-EMO O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	945
Then there was Warlock	O O O O	happiness	945
Of course one could see at once that he was an extraordinary man	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	945
a kind of prophet all on his own	O O O O O O O O	happiness	945
Oh yes	O O	sadness	946
one of them went back	O O O O O	sadness	946

But his actual meeting with his girl was so disappointing in comparison with his long expectation of it in front of the Temple that he took the next boat back to the island	O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	946

once or twice the voice dropped so low that Maggie did not catch the words	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	978

No less marked than her torture was her courage and the expectation that sustained that courage.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1027
It was as though they both inwardly realised that there was trouble for them of every kind waiting outside and that they could only definitely realise their happiness by building a wall around themselves	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1028
They knew perhaps in their secret hearts	O O O O O O O	happiness	1028
or at any rate Martin knew	O O O O O O	happiness	1028
that they could not hold their castle for long.	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1028
Also a magnificent lady	O O O O	fear	1029
in furs so rich that you could see nothing of her but her powdered nose	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1029
was waving ropes of pearls about in a blase manner very close to them	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1029
and Maggie had a strange	O O O O O	fear	1029
entirely unreasonable fear that this splendour would suddenly turn round and snatch the little pearl ring and go off with it.	O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1029
Martin	O	happiness	1030
although he would willingly have given her the most gorgeous ring in the shop	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1030
was delighted to find that her taste was so good	O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1030
and like herself	O B-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1030
He had great ideas about taste	O O O O O O	happiness	1030
some of his secret fears had been lest her strange uncouth upbringing should have caused her to like gaudy things.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1030
"""Just see whether it fits"	O O O O O	sadness	1031

""" he said"	O O O	sadness	1031
"At the word ""darling"" the prophet cast another despairing look about the shop"	O O O O O O O O B-EMO O O O O	sadness	1031
as though he knew well the length of time that lovers could take over these things if they once put their hearts into it	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1031
Maggie was ashamed of her stubby finger as she put her hand forward--but the ring fitted exactly.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1031
They were both so fat and he had his coat and waistcoat off and he was kissing her neck	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1033
My word	O O	fear	1033
they were frightened when they saw me standing there	O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1033
After that I could do what I liked with the cook	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1033
We used to have prayer meetings in the drawing-room	O O O O O O O O O	fear	1033
and sometimes father would pray so hard that the glass chandelier would shake and rattle till I used to think it would come down.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1033
I always knew I could turn them round my little finger	O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1034
I always knew he'd rather do anything than make me unhappy	O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O B-EMO	sadness	1034
Sometimes we had lovely times together	O O O O O O	sadness	1034
sitting in the dusk in the front of the fire.	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1034
It was a terrific excitement for her	O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O O	happiness	1035
apart altogether from her love for Martin	O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1035
She had	O O	happiness	1035
of course	O O	happiness	1035
never been to a theatre	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1035
She could not imagine in the least what it was like.	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1035
They started off towards Shaftesbury Avenue where the theatre was	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1037
and as they went a funny little incident occurred	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1037
They were both too happy to talk and Maggie was too happy even to think	O O O O B-EMO O O O O O O O O O B-CAU	happiness	1037
Suddenly she was aware that some one was coming towards her whom she knew	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1037
She looked and tugged herself from that world of Martin and only Martin in which she was immersed.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1037
Martin moved on a little and stood waiting for her	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1038
She was confused and embarrassed but pleased too because he seemed glad to see her	O O B-EMO O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1038
He looked the very picture of a well-dressed	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1038
kindly	O	happiness	1038
genial friend who had known her all his life	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1038
He was wearing a beautifully shining top-hat and his stiff white collar gleamed.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1038
Martin moved on a little and stood waiting for her	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1039
She was confused and embarrassed but pleased too because @he seemed glad to see her	O O B-EMO O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1039

Martin moved on a little and stood waiting for her	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1041
She was confused and embarrassed but pleased too because he seemed glad to see her	O O O O O O B-EMO O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1041

He was wearing a beautifully shining top-hat and his stiff white collar gleamed.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1041
Stupid the pleasure that his few words had given her	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1042
but she felt once again	O O O O O	happiness	1042
as she had felt in Katherine Mark's drawing-room	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1042
the contact with that other world	O O O O O O	happiness	1042
that safe	O O	happiness	1042
happy	O	happiness	1042
comfortable	O	happiness	1042
assured world in which everything was exactly what it seemed	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1042
She was glad that he liked her and that his sister liked her	O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1042
Then she could not be so wild and odd and uncivilised as she often was afraid that she was.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1042
As he breathed she breathed too	O O O O O O	sadness	1044
and it seemed to her that their bodies rose and fell as one body	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1044
Without looking directly at him	O O O O O	sadness	1044
which would	O O	sadness	1044
she knew	O O	sadness	1044
embarrass him before all those hungry people behind her	B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1044
she could out of the corner of her eye see the ruddy brown of his cheek and the hard thick curve of his shoulder.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1044
But meanwhile	O O	sadness	1046
of course	O O	sadness	1046
she saw a handsome young soldier who was young like herself	O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1046
and she was naturally bored with the studious gentleman	O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1046
Maggie shared all the feelings of the Charity girl	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1046
Had she been brought up	O O O O O	sadness	1046
say by a man like Mr	O O O O O O	sadness	1046
Trenchard and then had met Martin	O O O O O O	sadness	1046
why	O	sadness	1046
of course	O O	sadness	1046
she could have gone only one way.	O O O O O O O	sadness	1046
Tea came	O O	happiness	1047
but she could not eat anythingIn some strange way that moment in the theatre when he had pressed her hand had altered everythingShe recognised in herself a new Maggie	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1047
she was excited with a thick burning excitement	O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1047
she was almost sleepy with the strain of it and her cheeks were hot	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1047
but her throat icy coldWhen she told him that she wasn't hungry	O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1047
he said	O O	happiness	1047
"""I'm not either"	O O O	happiness	1047
Then he added	O O O	happiness	1047
not looking at her	O O O O	happiness	1047
"""That fellow won't be back for an hour."""	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1047
She remembered his dark look	O O O O O	happiness	1048
his frown when she had refused himOh	O O O O O O O	happiness	1048
this loneliness	O O	happiness	1048
this helplessness	O O	happiness	1048
If she could be with him	O O O O O O	happiness	1048
beside him	B-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1048
she would fear nothing	O O B-EMO I-EMO	happiness	1048
That night	O O	happiness	1048
the first faint suspicion of jealousy	O O O O O O	happiness	1048
of doubt	O O	happiness	1048
an agonising dart of pain at the knowledge of what it would mean to her now if he left her	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1048
stirred in her breastThis room was stifling	O O O O O O O	happiness	1048
Aunt Anne's aloofness was coloured now with a very human anger	O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1049
Maggie realised with surprise that she had never seen her angry before	O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1049
She had been indignant	O O O O	surprise	1049
disapproving	O	surprise	1049
superior	O	surprise	1049
forbidding	O	surprise	1049
but never angry.	O O O	surprise	1049
The mist of anger dimmed the room	O O O O O O O	fear	1050
it was in the potatoes and the cold dry mutton	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1050
especially was it in the hard pallid knobs of cheese	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1050
And Aunt Elizabeth	O O O	fear	1050
although she was frightened by her sister's anger on this occasion	O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1050
shared in it	O O O	fear	1050
She pursed her lips at Maggie and moved her fat	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1050
podgy hand as though she would like to smack Maggie's cheeks.	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1050
She went up to her bedroom	O O O O O O	fear	1054
and when she reached it she realised	O O O O O O O	fear	1054
with a little pang of fright	B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO	fear	1054
that she was a prisoner	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1054

and I think of you all the time and wonder how you are	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1055
Don't be unhappy	O O O	fear	1055
Martin--that's the one thing I couldn't bear.	O O O O O O O	fear	1055
You know me better than any of them do and I am just as you know me	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1057
every bit	O O	anger	1057
The aunts are very angry because they say I deceived them	O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	1057
but they haven't any right to tell me who I shall love	O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1057
have they	O O	anger	1057
No one has	O O O	anger	1057
I am myself and nobody's ever cared for me except you--and Uncle Mathew	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1057
so I don't see why I should think of anybody.	O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1057

She'd be unhappy for a bit	O O B-EMO O O O	sadness	1058

She	O	sadness	1059
knowing nothing of the world	O O O O O	sadness	1059
could disregard it	O O O	sadness	1059
but HE knew	O O O	sadness	1059
knew that daily	O O O	sadness	1059
hourly recurrence of alights and insults and disappointments	O O O O O O O B-EMO	sadness	1059

He would like to have gone on and asked other questions	O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1061
but the old man seemed so worn out and exhausted that he was afraid of distressing him	O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1061
so he just sat there	O O O O O	sadness	1061
his hands on his shoulders	O O O O O	sadness	1061
and suddenly the white head nodded	O O O O O O	sadness	1061
the beard sank over the breast and huddled up in the chair as though life itself had left him	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1061
the old man slept.	O O O O	sadness	1061

mysteriously	O	happiness	1063
as though she enjoyed her share in the conspiracy	O O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1063
Maggie sped upstairs	O O O	happiness	1063
and now with Martin's words in her ears	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1063
had enough to stiffen her back for the battle.	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1063

out for any sensation that might come along	O O O O O O O O	sadness	1064

again	O	sadness	1064
like Amy Warlock's	O O O	sadness	1064
grimly set upon secret thoughts and purposes of their own	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1064
faces trained to withstand any sudden attack on the emotions	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1064

too	O	sadness	1064
like the rest for some revelation that was to answer all questions and satisfy all expectations.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1064
Maggie wondered	O O	sadness	1065
as she looked about her	O O O O O	sadness	1065
how she could have raised in her own imagination	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1065
around the Chapel and its affairs	O O O O O O	sadness	1065
so formidable an atmosphere of terror and tyrannic discipline	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1065
Here gathered together were a few women	O O O O O O O	sadness	1065
tired	B-CAU	sadness	1065
pale	B-CAU	sadness	1065
many of them uneducated	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1065
awaiting like children the opening of a box	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1065
the springing into flower of a dry husk of a seed	O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1065
the raising of the curtain on some wonderful scene	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1065
Maggie	O	sadness	1065
as she looked at them	O O O O O	sadness	1065
knew that they must be disappointed	O O O O O B-EMO	sadness	1065
and her heart ached for them all	O O O O O O O	sadness	1065
yes	O	sadness	1065
even for Amy Warlock	O O O O	sadness	1065
her declared enemy.	O O O	sadness	1065
She only saw them all tired and hungry and expectant	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1066
perhaps	O	happiness	1066
after all	O O	happiness	1066
there WAS something behind it all--something for which they had a right to be searching	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1066
even of that she had not sure knowledge-- but the pathos and also the bravery of their search touched and moved her	O O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O	happiness	1066
She was beginning to understand something of the beauty that hovered like a bird always just out of sight about the ugly walls of the Chapel.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1066
Only Martin was flesh and blood	O O O O O O	fear	1067
to be loved and longed for and feared for just as he had always been	O O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1067
All the physical properties of life--clothes	O O O O O O	fear	1067
food	O	fear	1067
household possessions	O O	fear	1067
money--became of less and less importance to him	O O O O O O O O	fear	1067
Had Amy not watched over him he would have been many days without any food at all	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1067

Nevertheless the thought of his struggling on there alone was not a happy one	O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO	sadness	1068
She longed	O O	sadness	1068
even though she might not advise him	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1068
to comfort him	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1068
She was beginning to realise something of her own power over him and to see	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1068
too	O	sadness	1068
the strange mixture of superstition and self-reproach and self-distrust that overwhelmed him when she was not with him.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1068
Maggie thought	O O	sadness	1069
watching her aunt's austere composure from the other side of the dining-table	O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1069
She was sad at the thought of that	O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1069
remembering moments--that first visit to St	O O O O O O	sadness	1069

the departure in the cab	O O O O O	sadness	1069
the night when she had sat at her aunt's bedside--that had given glimpses of the kind human creature Aunt Anne might have been had she never heard of the Inside Saints.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1069
When the last day of the year arrived Maggie was surprised at the strange excitement that she felt	O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1070
It was excitement	O O O	surprise	1070
not only because of the dim mysterious events that the evening promised	O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1070
but also because she was sure that this day would settle the loneliness of herself and Martin.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1070
She had not been certain	O O O O O	fear	1071

It may well be believed that the prince felt in despair at this fresh misfortune	O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1122

As he could not well cultivate the garden by himself	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1122
he engaged a lad to help him	O O O O O O O	sadness	1122

His father	O O	happiness	1168
pleased at his interest	B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1168
was glad to explain so that even at this early age--from ten to fifteen--the boy gained a wide knowledge of the condition of the country financially--what a State bank was and what a national one	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1168
what brokers did	O O O	happiness	1168
what stocks were	O O O	happiness	1168
and why they fluctuated in value.	O O O O O O	happiness	1168
Later	O	fear	1169
in connection with the scheme to make Texas a State of the Union	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1169
a bill was passed providing a contribution on the part of the United States of five million dollars	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1169
to be applied to the extinguishment of this old debt	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1169
Grund knew of this	O O O O	fear	1169
and also of the fact that some of this debt	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1169
owing to the peculiar conditions of issue	O O O O O O O	fear	1169
was to be paid in full	O O O O O O	fear	1169
while other portions were to be scaled down	O O O O O O O O	fear	1169
and there was to be a false or pre-arranged failure to pass the bill at one session in order to frighten off the outsiders who might have heard and begun to buy the old certificates for profit	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O B-EMO I-EMO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1169
He acquainted the Third National Bank with this fact	O O O O O O O O O	fear	1169
and of course the information came to Cowperwood as teller.	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1169

Measuring twenty by twenty-four and finished in imitation cherry	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1172
with a set of new Sheraton parlor furniture it presented a quaintly harmonious aspect	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1172
Since Henry had become teller the family had acquired a piano--a decided luxury in those days-- brought from Europe	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1172
and it was intended that Anna Adelaide	O O O O O O O	happiness	1172
when she was old enough	O O O O O	happiness	1172
should learn to play	O O O O	happiness	1172
There were a few uncommon ornaments in the room--a gas chandelier for one thing	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1172
a glass bowl with goldfish in it	O O O O O O O	happiness	1172
some rare and highly polished shells	O O O O O O	happiness	1172
and a marble Cupid bearing a basket of flowers	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1172
It was summer time	O O O O	happiness	1172
the windows were open	O O O O	happiness	1172
and the trees outside	O O O O	happiness	1172
with their widely extended green branches	O O O O O O	happiness	1172
were pleasantly visible shading the brick sidewalk	O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1172
Uncle Seneca strolled out into the back yard.	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1172
Young Cowperwood's mind was working	O O O O O	disgust	1173
He had no money with him	O O O O O O	disgust	1173
but his father was teller of the Third National Bank	O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1173
and he could quote him as reference	O O O O O O O	disgust	1173
He could sell all of his soap to the family grocer	O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1173
surely	O	disgust	1173
or	O	disgust	1173
if not	O O	disgust	1173
to other grocers	O O O	disgust	1173
Other people were anxious to get this soap at this price	O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	1173
Why not he	O O O	disgust	1173
He was	O O	happiness	1175
to look at	O O O	happiness	1175
a phlegmatic type of man--short	O O O O O	happiness	1175
stout	O	happiness	1175
wrinkled about the eyes	O O O O	happiness	1175
rather protuberant as to stomach	O O O O O	happiness	1175
red-necked	O	happiness	1175
red-faced	O	happiness	1175
the least bit popeyed	O O O O	happiness	1175
but shrewd	O O	happiness	1175
kindly	O	happiness	1175
good-natured	O	happiness	1175
and witty	O O	happiness	1175
He had	O O	happiness	1175
because of his naturally common-sense ideas and rather pleasing disposition built up a sound and successful business here	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1175
He was getting strong in years and would gladly have welcomed the hearty cooperation of his son	O O O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O O O O O O	happiness	1175
if the latter had been entirely suited to the business.	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1175
Then came young Cowperwood	O O O O	happiness	1176
spoken of to him by Seneca Davis	O O O O O O O	happiness	1176
He looked him over critically	O O O O O	happiness	1176
Yes	O	happiness	1176
this boy might do	O O O O	happiness	1176
he thought	O O	happiness	1176
There was something easy and sufficient about him	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1176
He did not appear to be in the least flustered or disturbed	O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1176
He knew how to keep books	O O O O O O	happiness	1176
he said	O O	happiness	1176
though he knew nothing of the details of the grain and commission business	O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1176
It was interesting to him	O O B-EMO O O	happiness	1176
He would like to try it.	O O O O O O	happiness	1176
The Watermans	O O	happiness	1179
Henry and George	O O O	happiness	1179
were greatly pleased with the way he handled their accounts	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1179
There was a sense of security in his very presence	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1179
He soon began to call Brother George's attention to the condition of certain accounts	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1179
making suggestions as to their possible liquidation or discontinuance	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1179
which pleased that individual greatly	O B-EMO O O O	happiness	1179
He saw a way of lightening his own labors through the intelligence of this youth	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1179
while at the same time developing a sense of pleasant companionship with him.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1179
Cowperwood smiled his hearty	O O O O	happiness	1182
genial smile	O O	happiness	1182
He was feeling very comfortable under this evidence of approval	O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1182
He looked bright and cheery in his well-made clothes of English tweed.	O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1182
On the way home that evening he speculated as to the nature of this business	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1185
He knew he wasn't going to stay there long	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1185
even in spite of this gift and promise of salary	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1185
They were grateful	O O B-EMO	happiness	1185
of course	O O	happiness	1185
but why shouldn't they be	O O O O O	happiness	1185
He was efficient	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1185
he knew that	O O O	happiness	1185
under him things moved smoothly	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1185
It never occurred to him that he belonged in the realm of clerkdom.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1185
It was only two weeks later that Frank took his departure from Waterman & Company	O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	1189
interested and yet in no way flustered by his new prospects	O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1189
And great was the grief of Mr	O O O O O O O	anger	1189
George Waterman	O O	anger	1189
As for Mr	O O O	anger	1189
Henry Waterman	O O	anger	1189
he was actually irritated by this defection.	O O O B-EMO O O O	anger	1189
"""I know it"	O O O	fear	1191
""" smiled Cowperwood"	O O O	fear	1191
"""but I don't like it"	O O O O O	fear	1191
I have other plans in view	O O O O O O	fear	1191
I'll never be a grain and commission man	O O O O O O O O	fear	1191
Henry Waterman could scarcely understand why obvious success in this field did not interest him	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1191
He feared the effect of his departure on the business.	O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1191
The occasion of the meeting was an evening call on the part of the Semples	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1193
Mr	O	happiness	1193
Semple being desirous of talking with Henry Cowperwood concerning a new transportation feature which was then entering the world--namely	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1193
street-cars	O	happiness	1193
A tentative line	O O O	happiness	1193
incorporated by the North Pennsylvania Railway Company	O O O O O O O	happiness	1193
had been put into operation on a mile and a half of tracks extending from Willow Street along Front to Germantown Road	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1193
and thence by various streets to what was then known as the Cohocksink Depot	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1193
and it was thought that in time this mode of locomotion might drive out the hundreds of omnibuses which now crowded and made impassable the downtown streets	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1193
Young Cowperwood had been greatly interested from the start	O O O O B-EMO I-EMO O O O	happiness	1193
Railway transportation	O O	happiness	1193
as a whole	O O O	happiness	1193
interested him	O O	happiness	1193
anyway	O	happiness	1193
but this particular phase was most fascinating.	O O O O O O O	happiness	1193
There was great talk concerning morality	O O O O O O	disgust	1196
much praise of virtue and decency	O O O O O O	disgust	1196
and much lifting of hands in righteous horror at people who broke or were even rumored to have broken the Seventh Commandment	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1196
He did not take this talk seriously	O O O O O O O	disgust	1196
Already he had broken it secretly many times	O O O O O O O O	disgust	1196
Other young men did	O O O O	disgust	1196
Yet again	O O	disgust	1196
he was a little sick of the women of the streets and the bagnio	O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	1196
There were too many coarse	O O O O O	disgust	1196
evil features in connection with such contacts.	O O O O O O O	disgust	1196
At first	O O	happiness	1198
when Frank called	O O O	happiness	1198
she did not have much to say	O O O O O O O	happiness	1198
She was gracious	O O O	happiness	1198
but the burden of conversation fell on her husband	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1198
Cowperwood watched the varying expression of her face from time to time	O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1198
and if she had been at all psychic she must have felt something	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1198
Fortunately she was not	O O O O	happiness	1198
Semple talked to him pleasantly	O O O O B-EMO	happiness	1198
because in the first place Frank was becoming financially significant	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1198
was suave and ingratiating	O O O O	happiness	1198
and in the next place he was anxious to get richer and somehow Frank represented progress to him in that line	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1198
One spring evening they sat on the porch and talked--nothing very important--slavery	O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1198
street-cars	O	happiness	1198
the panic--it was on then	O O O O O	happiness	1198
that of 1857--the development of the West.	O O O O O O O	happiness	1198
Thereafter	O	happiness	1200
for a year or so	O O O O O	happiness	1200
Cowperwood bought his shoes of Mr	O O O O O O	happiness	1200
Semple	O	happiness	1200
Occasionally also he stopped in the Chestnut Street store to exchange the time of the day	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1200
Semple asked his opinion as to the advisability of buying some shares in the Fifth and Sixth Street line	O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1200
which	O	happiness	1200
having secured a franchise	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1200
was creating great excitement	O O O B-EMO	happiness	1200
Cowperwood gave him his best judgment	O O O O O O	happiness	1200
It was sure to be profitable	O O O O O O	happiness	1200
He himself had purchased one hundred shares at five dollars a share	O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1200
and urged Semple to do so	O O O O O O	happiness	1200
But he was not interested in him personally	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1200
He liked Mrs	O O O	happiness	1200
Semple	O	happiness	1200
though he did not see her very often.	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1200
He could not think of her reasonably	O O O O O O O	happiness	1201
and he did not talk of her much to any one	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1201
His family knew that he went to see her	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1201
but there had grown up in the Cowperwood family a deep respect for the mental force of Frank	O O O O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1201
He was genial	O O O	happiness	1201
cheerful	O	happiness	1201
gay at most times	O O O O	happiness	1201
without being talkative	O O O	happiness	1201
and he was decidedly successful	O O O O O	happiness	1201
Everybody knew he was making money now	O O O O O O O	happiness	1201
His salary was fifty dollars a week	O O O O O O O	happiness	1201
and he was certain soon to get more.	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1201
There was a long conversation--a long wait	O O O O O O O	disgust	1203
His father came back to say it was doubtful whether they could make the loan	O O O O O O O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	1203
Eight per cent	O O O	disgust	1203
then being secured for money	O O O O O	disgust	1203
was a small rate of interest	O O O O O O	disgust	1203
considering its need.	O O O	disgust	1203
In spite of her fears and her uncertainty	O O O O O O O O	sadness	1206
Lillian Semple accepted his attentions and interest because	O O O O O O O O	sadness	1206
equally in spite of herself	O O O O O	sadness	1206
she was drawn to him	O O O O O	sadness	1206
One night	O O	sadness	1206
when she was going to bed	O O O O O O	sadness	1206
she stopped in front of her dressing table and looked at her face and her bare neck and arms	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1206
They were very pretty	O O O O	sadness	1206
A subtle something came over her as she surveyed her long	O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1206
peculiarly shaded hair	O O O	sadness	1206
She thought of young Cowperwood	O O O O O	sadness	1206
and then was chilled and shamed by the vision of the late Mr	O O O B-EMO O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1206
Semple and the force and quality of public opinion.	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1206

excited.	B-EMO	happiness	1209
"""Oh"	O	happiness	1211

falling limp on his shoulder when he refused to let her go	O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1211
Then	O	happiness	1211
because of the set determination of his face	O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1211
some intense pull in him	O O O O O	happiness	1211

Cowperwood had implicit faith in the future of the street railway	O O B-EMO I-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1214
In support of this belief he risked all he could spare on new issues of stock shares in new companies	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1214
He wanted to be on the inside wherever possible	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1214
always	O	happiness	1214
though this was a little difficult in the matter of the street-railways	O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1214
he having been so young when they started and not having yet arranged his financial connections to make them count for much.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1214
The home atmosphere which they established when they returned from their honeymoon was a great improvement in taste over that which had characterized the earlier life of Mrs	O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1217

on North Front Street	O O O O	happiness	1217
for a while at least.	O O O O O	happiness	1217
Those who recall the early years of their married life can best realize the subtle changes which this new condition brought to Frank	O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1219
for	O	happiness	1219
like all who accept the hymeneal yoke	O O O O O O O	happiness	1219
he was influenced to a certain extent by the things with which he surrounded himself	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1219
Primarily	O	happiness	1219
from certain traits of his character	O O O O O O	happiness	1219
one would have imagined him called to be a citizen of eminent respectability and worth	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1219
He appeared to be an ideal home man	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1219
He delighted to return to his wife in the evenings	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1219
leaving the crowded downtown section where traffic clamored and men hurried	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1219
Here he could feel that he was well-stationed and physically happy in life	O O O O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO O O	happiness	1219

held him	O O	happiness	1219
To live richly	O O O	happiness	1219
joyously	O	happiness	1219
fully--his whole nature craved that.	O O O O O	happiness	1219
And Mrs	O O	happiness	1223
Cowperwood	O	happiness	1223
in spite of the difference in their years	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1223
appeared to be a fit mate for him at this time	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1223
She was once awakened	O O O O	happiness	1223
and for the time being	O O O O O	happiness	1223
clinging	O	happiness	1223
responsive	O	happiness	1223
dreamy	O	happiness	1223
His mood and hers was for a baby	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1223
and in a little while that happy expectation was whispered to him by her	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1223
She had half fancied that her previous barrenness was due to herself	O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1223
and was rather surprised and delighted at the proof that it was not so	O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1223
It opened new possibilities--a seemingly glorious future of which she was not afraid	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1223
He liked it	O O O	happiness	1223
the idea of self-duplication.	O O O O	happiness	1223
There was so much to think of in this connection--the spermatozoic beginning	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1224
the strange period of gestation in women	O O O O O O O	fear	1224
the danger of disease and delivery	O O O O O O	fear	1224
He had gone through a real period of strain when Frank	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1224
Jr	O	fear	1224

for Mrs	O O	fear	1224
Cowperwood was frightened	O O O	fear	1224
He feared for the beauty of her body--troubled over the danger of losing her	O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1224
and he actually endured his first worry when he stood outside the door the day the child came	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1224
Not much--he was too self-sufficient	O O O O O	fear	1224
too resourceful	O O	fear	1224
and yet he worried	O O O O	fear	1224
conjuring up thoughts of death and the end of their present state.	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1224
He had gone through a real period of strain when Frank	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1225

Cowperwood was frightened	O O O	fear	1225
He feared for the beauty of her body--troubled over the danger of losing her	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1225

Then word came	O O O	fear	1225
after certain piercing	O O O	fear	1225
harrowing cries	O O	fear	1225
that all was well	O O O O	fear	1225
and he was permitted to look at the new arrival.	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1225
The children took up a great deal of her time	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1227
However	O	happiness	1227
Cowperwood was not troubled about this	O O O O O O	happiness	1227
It struck him as delightful and exceedingly worth while that she should be so devoted	O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1227
At the same time	O O O O	happiness	1227
her lethargic manner	O O O	happiness	1227
vague smile and her sometimes seeming indifference	O O O O O O O	happiness	1227
which sprang largely from a sense of absolute security	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1227
attracted him also.	O O O	happiness	1227
Then came meetings	O O O	fear	1228
public and stirring	O O O	fear	1228
and riots	O O	fear	1228
the incident of John Brown's body	O O O O O O	fear	1228
the arrival of Lincoln	O O O O	fear	1228
the great commoner	O O O	fear	1228
on his way from Springfield	O O O O O	fear	1228
Illinois	O	fear	1228
to Washington via Philadelphia	O O O O	fear	1228
to take the oath of office	O O O O O O	fear	1228
the battle of Bull Run	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1228
the battle of Vicksburg	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1228
the battle of Gettysburg	O O O O	fear	1228
and so on	O O O	fear	1228
Cowperwood was only twenty-five at the time	O O O O O O O	fear	1228
a cool	O O	fear	1228
determined youth	O O	fear	1228
who thought the slave agitation might be well founded in human rights--no doubt was --but exceedingly dangerous to trade	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO O O	fear	1228
He hoped the North would win	O O O O O O	fear	1228
but it might go hard with him personally and other financiers	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1228
He did not care to fight	O O O O O O	fear	1228
That seemed silly for the individual man to do.	O O O O O O O O O	fear	1228
This current war-spirit was strange	O O O O O	fear	1230
The people seemed to him to want to hear nothing but the sound of the drum and fife	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1230
to see nothing but troops	O O O O O	fear	1230
of which there were thousands now passing through on their way to the front	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1230
carrying cold steel in the shape of guns at their shoulders	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1230
to hear of war and the rumors of war	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1230
It was a thrilling sentiment	O O O B-EMO O	fear	1230
no doubt	O O	fear	1230
great but unprofitable	O O O	fear	1230
It meant self-sacrifice	O O O	fear	1230
and he could not see that	O O O O O O	fear	1230
If he went he might be shot	O O O O O O O	fear	1230
and what would his noble emotion amount to then	O O O O O O O O O	fear	1230
He would rather make money	O O O O O	fear	1230
regulate current political	O O O	fear	1230
social and financial affairs	O O O O	fear	1230
The poor fool who fell in behind the enlisting squad--no	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1230
not fool	O O	fear	1230
he would not call him that--the poor overwrought working-man--well	O O O O O O O O O	fear	1230
Heaven pity him	O O O	fear	1230
Heaven pity all of them	O O O O O	fear	1230
They really did not know what they were doing.	O O O O O O O O O	fear	1230
"""I happen to be interested just at present in pickin' up certain street-railway stocks on 'change"	O O O O B-EMO O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1231

Won't you have somethin' to drink	O O O O O O	happiness	1231
"It's a cold morning."""	O O O O	happiness	1231
Cowperwood	O	happiness	1232
warm with this enhancing of his financial prospects	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1232
went down the steps	O O O O	happiness	1232
but incidentally he spared a passing thought for the gay spirit of youth that had manifested itself in this red-cheeked maiden	O O O O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1232
What a bright	O O O	happiness	1232
healthy	O	happiness	1232
bounding girl	O O	happiness	1232
Her voice had the subtle	O O O O O	happiness	1232
vigorous ring of fifteen or sixteen	O O O O O O	happiness	1232
She was all vitality	O O O O	happiness	1232
What a fine catch for some young fellow some day	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1232
and her father would make him rich	O O O O O O O	happiness	1232
no doubt	O O	happiness	1232
or help to.	O O O	happiness	1232
And Cowperwood felt confident when he left the house that evening that Butler would not fail him but would set the wheels working	O O B-EMO I-EMO O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1233
Therefore	O	happiness	1233
he was not surprised	O O O O	happiness	1233
and knew exactly what it meant	O O O O O O	happiness	1233
when a few days later he was introduced to City Treasurer Julian Bode	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1233
who promised to introduce him to State Treasurer Van Nostrand and to see that his claims to consideration were put before the people	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1233
"""Of course"	O O	happiness	1233

in the presence of Butler	O O O O O	happiness	1233
for it was at the latter's home that the conference took place	O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1233
"""this banking crowd is very powerful"	O O O O O O	happiness	1233

He went away thinking how surprised Drexel & Co	O O O O O B-EMO O O O	surprise	1234
and Cooke & Co	O O O O	surprise	1234
would be to see him appearing in the field as a competitor	O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1234
In his home	O O O	surprise	1234

which he had fixed up as an office with a desk	O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1234
a safe	O O	surprise	1234
and a leather chair	O O O O	surprise	1234
he consulted his resources.	O O O O	surprise	1234
She had already learned that the Butlers were rather showy--the younger generation--that they were sensitive as to their lineage	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1235
and that money in their estimation was supposed to make up for any deficiency in any other respect	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1235
"""Butler himself is a very presentable man"	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1235

The birth and care of two children had made some difference in her looks	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1236
She was no longer as softly pleasing	O O O O O O O	fear	1236

In short she was a little run down nervously and suffered from fits of depression	O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO	sadness	1237
Cowperwood had noticed this	O O O O	sadness	1237
He tried to be gentle and considerate	O O O O O O O	sadness	1237
but he was too much of a utilitarian and practical-minded observer not to realize that he was likely to have a sickly wife on his hands later.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1237
He was not at all sure	O O O O O O	disgust	1240
for instance	O O	disgust	1240
that the negroes could be made into anything much more significant than they were	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1240
At any rate	O O O	disgust	1240
it was a long uphill struggle for them	O O O O O O O O	disgust	1240
of which many future generations would not witness the conclusion	O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1240
He had no particular quarrel with the theory that they should be free	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1240
he saw no particular reason why the South should not protest vigorously against the destruction of their property and their system	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1240
It was too bad that the negroes as slaves should be abused in some instances	O O B-EMO I-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	1240
He felt sure that that ought to be adjusted in some way	O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1240
but beyond that he could not see that there was any great ethical basis for the contentions of their sponsors.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1240
He was not of those who complained bitterly of the excessive war taxes	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1242
though he knew them to be trying to many	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1242
Some of the stories of death and disaster moved him greatly	O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1242
but	O	sadness	1242
alas	O	sadness	1242
they were among the unaccountable fortunes of life	O O O O O O O O	sadness	1242
and could not be remedied by him	O O O O O O O	sadness	1242
So he had gone his way day by day	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1242
watching the coming in and the departing of troops	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1242

disheveled	O	sadness	1242

and all he could do was to feel sorry	O O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO	sadness	1242
This war was not for him	O O O O O O	sadness	1242
He had taken no part in it	O O O O O O O	sadness	1242
and he felt sure that he could only rejoice in its conclusion--not as a patriot	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1242
but as a financier	O O O O	sadness	1242
It was wasteful	O O O	sadness	1242
pathetic	O	sadness	1242
unfortunate.	O	sadness	1242
Intelligence	O	happiness	1247
of a raw	O O O	happiness	1247
crude order she had certainly--also a native force	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1247
tamed somewhat by the doctrines and conventions of current society	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1247
still showed clear at times in an elemental and not entirely unattractive way	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1247

She supplied something he had not previously known or consciously craved	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1247
Vitality and vivacity.	O O O	happiness	1247
But these facts of wealth and advantage gripped her	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU B-EMO I-EMO	fear	1248
and when she sat at the piano and played or rode in her carriage or walked or stood before her mirror	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1248
she was conscious of her figure	O O O O O O	fear	1248
her charms	O O	fear	1248
what they meant to men	O O O O O	fear	1248
how women envied her	O O O O	fear	1248
Sometimes she looked at poor	O O O O O	fear	1248
hollow-chested or homely-faced girls and felt sorry for them	O O O O O O O O O	fear	1248
at other times she flared into inexplicable opposition to some handsome girl or woman who dared to brazen her socially or physically.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1248

It became an old story later	O O O O O O	happiness	1254
but it was new at that time	O O O O O O O	happiness	1254
and he kept the thought closely to himself	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1254
None the less he was glad to have Stener speak of this	O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1254
since street-railways were his hobby	O O O O O	happiness	1254
and he was convinced that he would be a great master of them if he ever had an opportunity to control them.	O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1254
Butler was sorry that he had called his youngest a baggage	O B-EMO I-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1256
but these children--God bless his soul--were a great annoyance	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1256
Why	O	sadness	1256
in the name of all the saints	O O O O O O O	sadness	1256
wasn't this house good enough for them	O O O O O O O	sadness	1256
But no	O O	anger	1258
her father	O O	anger	1258
whom she loved dearly	O O O O	anger	1258
was of the old school	O O O O O	anger	1258
He was just what people charged him with being	O O O O O O O O O	anger	1258
a rough Irish contractor	O O O O	anger	1258
He might be rich	O O O O	anger	1258
She flared up at the injustice of things--why couldn't he have been rich and refined	O B-EMO I-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O	anger	1258
too	O	anger	1258
Then they could have--but	O O O O	anger	1258
oh	O	anger	1258
what was the use of complaining	O O O O O O	anger	1258
They would never get anywhere with her father and mother in charge	O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1258
She would just have to wait	O O O O O O	anger	1258
Marriage was the answer--the right marriage	O O O O O O	anger	1258
But whom was she to marry	O O O O O O	anger	1258
It was curious	O O O	anger	1259
though	O	anger	1259
that it was Aileen who commanded nearly all their attention and fixed their minds on her so-called idiosyncrasies	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1259
All they said was in its peculiar way true	O O O O O O O O O	anger	1259
but in addition the girl was really beautiful and much above the average intelligence and force	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1259
She was running deep with ambition	O O O O O O	anger	1259
and she was all the more conspicuous	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	1259
and in a way irritating to some	O O O O B-EMO O O	anger	1259
because she reflected in her own consciousness her social defects	O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1259
against which she was inwardly fighting	O O O O O O	anger	1259
She resented the fact that people could justly consider her parents ineligible	O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1259
and for that reason her also.	O O O O O O	anger	1259

He was not especially poetic	O O O O O	happiness	1264
He had not formulated the phrase beforehand	O O O O O O O	happiness	1264
Since his first glimpse of her in the hall	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1264
his feelings and ideas had been leaping and plunging like spirited horses	O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O	happiness	1264
This girl made him set his teeth and narrow his eyes	O O O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO	happiness	1264
Involuntarily he squared his jaw	O O O O O	happiness	1264
looking more defiant	O O O	happiness	1264
forceful	O	happiness	1264
efficient	O	happiness	1264
as she drew near	O O O O	happiness	1264
And then she came to the matter of a train-gown	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1267
Kathleen laid out five	O O O O	happiness	1267
for Aileen had come into the joy and honor of these things recently	O O O O O O O O B-EMO O O O O	happiness	1267
and she had	O O O	happiness	1267
with the permission of her mother and father	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1267
indulged herself to the full	O O O O O	happiness	1267
She studied a golden-yellow silk	O O O O O	happiness	1267
with cream-lace shoulder-straps	O O O	happiness	1267
and some gussets of garnet beads in the train that shimmered delightfully	O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1267
but set it aside.	O O O O	happiness	1267
Then she put on the black silk with its glistening crimsoned-silver sequins	O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1268
and	O	happiness	1268
lo	O	happiness	1268
it touched her	O O O	happiness	1268
She liked its coquettish drapery of tulle and silver about the hips	O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1268
"The ""overskirt"	O O	happiness	1268

She thrilled a little at the rustle of this black dress	O B-EMO O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1268
and thrust her chin and nose forward to make it set right	O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1268
Then after having Kathleen tighten her corsets a little more	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1268
she gathered the train over her arm by its train-band and looked again	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1268
Something was wanting.	O O O	happiness	1268

and each time that he did so there swept over him a sense of great vigor there	O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O	happiness	1269
of beautiful if raw	O O O O	happiness	1269
dynamic energy that to him was irresistible and especially so to-night	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1269
She was so young	O O O O	happiness	1269
She was beautiful	O O O	happiness	1269
this girl	O O	happiness	1269
and in spite of his wife's repeated derogatory comments he felt that she was nearer to his clear	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1269

for	O	fear	1272
in spite of her gay	O O O O O	fear	1272
aggressive force she was afraid of him	O O O O O O O	fear	1272

Now that he was so close to her	O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1272
dancing	O	fear	1272
she conceived of him as something quite wonderful	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1272

And despite his involved social and financial position	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1276

it was interesting to him to see how deliberately and even calculatingly--and worse	O O B-EMO O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O	happiness	1276
enthusiastically-- he was pumping the bellows that tended only to heighten the flames of his desire for this girl	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1276

It was a problem	O O O O	disgust	1285
like some of those knotty financial complications which presented themselves daily	O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1285

He couldn't leave his wife and fly with Aileen	O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1285
that was certain	O O O	disgust	1285

he was not at all sure that he wanted to	O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO	disgust	1285
He did not intend to leave his growing interests	O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1285

in contemplating his wife in connection with all this	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	1287

While she had yielded to his youthful enthusiasm for her after her husband's death	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1287
he had only since learned that she was a natural conservator of public morals--the cold purity of the snowdrift in so far as the world might see	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1287
combined at times with the murky mood of the wanton.	O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1287

why should there be concealment between them	O O O O O O O	sadness	1288
or at least mental evasion of a fact which physically she subscribed to	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1288

To be sure	O O O	anger	1290
she was devoted to him in her quiet way	O O O O O O O O O	anger	1290
not passionately (as he looked back he could not say that she had ever been that)	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1290
but intellectually	O O	anger	1290
Duty	O	anger	1290

played a great part in this.	O O O O O O	anger	1290

of course	O O	fear	1295
occasionally be broken up and destroyed	O O O O O O	fear	1295

but the force must be quite sufficient	O O O O O O O	fear	1295

Aileen had no spiritual dread whatever	O O O O O O	fear	1295
Cowperwood was without spiritual or religious feeling	O O O O O O O	fear	1295

Love her he did surely.	O O O O O	fear	1295
And as for safeguards against the production of new life--they were not mysteries to him any longer	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1296
He knew all about them	O O O O O	fear	1296
Care was the point of caution	O O O O O O	fear	1296
He had to be cautious	O O O O B-EMO	fear	1296
for he was so rapidly coming to be an influential and a distinguished man	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1296
Aileen	O	fear	1296
of course	O O	fear	1296
was not conscious	O O O	fear	1296
except in a vague way	O O O O O	fear	1296
of the drift of her passion	O O O O O O	fear	1296
the ultimate destiny to which this affection might lead was not clear to her	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1296
Her craving was for love--to be fondled and caressed--and she really did not think so much further	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1296
Further thoughts along this line were like rats that showed their heads out of dark holes in shadowy corners and scuttled back at the least sound	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1296
And	O	fear	1296
anyhow	O	fear	1296
all that was to be connected with Cowperwood would be beautiful	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1296
She really did not think that he loved her yet as he should	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1296
but he would	O O O	fear	1296
She did not know that she wanted to interfere with the claims of his wife	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1296
She did not think she did	O O O O O O	fear	1296
But it would not hurt Mrs	O O O O O O	fear	1296
Cowperwood if Frank loved her--Aileen--also.	O O O O O	fear	1296
for the time being there was love-making	O O O O O O O	happiness	1297
the usual billing and cooing of lovers in a simple and much less than final fashion	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1297
and the lovely horseback rides together under the green trees of the approaching spring were idyllic	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1297
Cowperwood awakened to a sense of joy in life such as he fancied	O O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O O O O O O	happiness	1297
in the blush of this new desire	O O O O O O O	happiness	1297
he had never experienced before	O O O O O	happiness	1297
Lillian had been lovely in those early days in which he had first called on her in North Front Street	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1297
and he had fancied himself unspeakably happy at that time	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1297
but that was nearly ten years since	O O O O O O O	happiness	1297
and he had forgotten.	O O O O	happiness	1297
He paused	O O	happiness	1300
She still gazed thoughtfully at the water below	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1300
her mind running out to a yacht on the sea with him	O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1300
a palace somewhere-- just they two	O O O O O O	happiness	1300
Her eyes	O O	happiness	1300
half closed	O O	happiness	1300
saw this happy world	O O O O	happiness	1300
and	O	happiness	1300
listening to him	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1300
she was fascinated.	O O B-EMO	happiness	1300
Mrs	O	happiness	1301
Cowperwood might die	O O O	happiness	1301
or he might run away with her at thirty-five when he had a million	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1301
Some adjustment would be made	O O O O O	happiness	1301
somehow	O	happiness	1301
Nature had given her this man	O O O O O O	happiness	1301
She relied on him implicitly	O O O O O	happiness	1301
When he told her that he would take care of her so that nothing evil should befall	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1301
she believed him fully	O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO	happiness	1301
Such sins are the commonplaces of the confessional.	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1301
That the modern home is the most beautiful of schemes	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1302
when based upon mutual sympathy and understanding between two	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1302
need not be questioned	O O O O	happiness	1302
And yet this fact should not necessarily carry with it a condemnation of all love not so fortunate as to find so happy a denouement	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1302
Life cannot be put into any mold	O O O O O O O	happiness	1302
and the attempt might as well be abandoned at once	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1302
Those so fortunate as to find harmonious companionship for life should congratulate themselves and strive to be worthy of it	O O B-EMO O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1302
Those not so blessed	O O O O	happiness	1302
though they be written down as pariahs	O O O O O O O	happiness	1302
have yet some justification	O O O O	happiness	1302
And	O	happiness	1302
besides	O	happiness	1302
whether we will or not	O O O O O	happiness	1302
theory or no theory	O O O O	happiness	1302
the basic facts of chemistry and physics remain	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1302
Like is drawn to like.	O O O O O	happiness	1302
These two felt unutterably bound to each other	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1303
Cowperwood	O	happiness	1303
once he came to understand her	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1303
fancied that he had found the one person with whom he could live happily the rest of his life	O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O O O O O	happiness	1303
She was so young	O O O O	happiness	1303
so confident	O O	happiness	1303
so hopeful	O O	happiness	1303
so undismayed	O O	happiness	1303
All these months since they had first begun to reach out to each other he had been hourly contrasting her with his wife.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1303
As it was he was constantly watching the certificates of loan issue	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1305
for the city treasury	O O O O	fear	1305
--buying large quantities when the market was falling to protect it and selling heavily	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1305
though cautiously	O O	fear	1305
when he saw it rising and to do this he had to have a great deal of free money to permit him to do it	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1305
He was constantly fearful of some break in the market which would affect the value of all his securities and result in the calling of his loans	O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1305
There was no storm in sight	O O O O O O	fear	1305
He did not see that anything could happen in reason	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1305
but he did not want to spread himself out too thin.	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1305
Things had changed considerably for him since the days when he had been fortuitously and almost indifferently made city treasurer	O O O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1306
His method of dressing had so much improved since he had been inducted into office	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1306
and his manner expressed so much more good feeling	O O O O O O O B-EMO I-EMO	happiness	1306
confidence	O	happiness	1306
aplomb	O	happiness	1306
that he would not have recognized himself if he had been permitted to see himself as had those who had known him before.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1306
His one pet idea	O O O O	fear	1309
the thing he put more faith in than anything else	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1309
was his street-railway manipulations	O O O O	fear	1309
and particularly his actual control of the Seventeenth and Nineteenth Street line	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1309
Through an advance to him	O O O O O	fear	1309
on deposit	O O	fear	1309
made in his bank by Stener at a time when the stock of the Seventeenth and Nineteenth Street line was at a low ebb	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1309
he had managed to pick up fifty-one per cent	O O O O O O O O O	fear	1309
of the stock for himself and Stener	O O O O O O O	fear	1309
by virtue of which he was able to do as he pleased with the road	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1309
To accomplish this	O O O	fear	1309
however	O	fear	1309
"he had resorted to some very ""peculiar"" methods"	O O O O O O O O	fear	1309
as they afterward came to be termed in financial circles	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1309
to get this stock at his own valuation	O O O O O O O O	fear	1309
Through agents he caused suits for damages to be brought against the company for non-payment of interest due	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1309
A little stock in the hands of a hireling	O O O O O O O O O	fear	1309
a request made to a court of record to examine the books of the company in order to determine whether a receivership were not advisable	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1309
a simultaneous attack in the stock market	O O O O O O O	fear	1309
selling at three	O O O	fear	1309
five	O	fear	1309
seven	O	fear	1309
and ten points off	O O O O	fear	1309
brought the frightened stockholders into the market with their holdings	O O B-EMO O O O O O O O	fear	1309
The banks considered the line a poor risk	O O O O O O O O	fear	1309
and called their loans in connection with it.	O O O O O O O O	fear	1309
This intoxicated him	O B-EMO O	happiness	1310
for immediately he saw the opportunity of fulfilling his long-contemplated dream--that of reorganizing the company in conjunction with the North Pennsylvania line	O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1310
issuing three shares where one had been before and after unloading all but a control on the general public	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1310
using the money secured to buy into other lines which were to be boomed and sold in the same way	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1310
In short	O O	happiness	1310
he was one of those early	O O O O O O	happiness	1310
daring manipulators who later were to seize upon other and ever larger phases of American natural development for their own aggrandizement.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1310
However	O	happiness	1312
by the spring and summer of 1871	O O O O O O O	happiness	1312
Cowperwood had actually	O O O	happiness	1312
without being in any conceivable danger from any source	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1312
spread himself out very thin	O O O O O	happiness	1312
Because of his great success he had grown more liberal--easier--in his financial ventures	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1312
By degrees	O O	happiness	1312
and largely because of his own confidence in himself	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1312
he had induced his father to enter upon his street-car speculations	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1312
to use the resources of the Third National to carry a part of his loans and to furnish capital at such times as quick resources were necessary	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1312
In the beginning the old gentleman had been a little nervous and skeptical	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1312
but as time had worn on and nothing but profit eventuated	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1312
he grew bolder and more confident.	O O O O B-EMO I-EMO	happiness	1312
Then	O	surprise	1315
after several years of this secret relationship	O O O O O O O	surprise	1315
in which the ties of sympathy and understanding grew stronger instead of weaker	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1315
came the storm	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1315
It burst unexpectedly and out of a clear sky	O O B-EMO O O O O O O	surprise	1315
and bore no relation to the intention or volition of any individual	O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1315
It was nothing more than a fire	O O O O O O O	surprise	1315
a distant one--the great Chicago fire	O O O O O O	surprise	1315
October 7th	O O	surprise	1315
1871	O	surprise	1315
which burned that city-- its vast commercial section--to the ground	O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1315
and instantly and incidentally produced a financial panic	O O O O O O O O	surprise	1315
vicious though of short duration in various other cities in America.	O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1315
Cowperwood	O	fear	1316
Sr	O	fear	1316
was already plucking at his side-whiskers in a confused and troubled way	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1316
He was cogitating as to what might happen to him in case his son failed	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1316
for he was deeply involved with him	O O O O O O O	fear	1316
He was a little gray in his complexion now	O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O O O O	fear	1316
frightened	O	fear	1316
for he had already strained many points in his affairs to accommodate his son	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1316

the onus and scandal of the situation would be on him.	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1316
"""Sure that's a nice little storm in a teapot"	O O O O O O O O O	fear	1319

Owen was running swiftly in his mind over Cowperwood's affairs--as much as he knew of them	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1320
He felt keenly that the banker ought to be shaken out	O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1320
This dilemma was his fault	O O O O O	surprise	1320
not Stener's--he felt	O O O	surprise	1320
It was strange to him that his father did not see it and resent it.	O O B-EMO O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1320
He was of a domestic turn of mind	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1321
Still	O	happiness	1321
Sunday evening being an excellent one for conference purposes generally in the world of politics	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1321
he was not without the thought that some one or other of his distinguished confreres might call	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1321
and when the combination footman and butler announced the presence of Butler and his son	O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1321
he was well pleased.	O O B-EMO I-EMO	happiness	1321
He hurried down the street to various bankers and brokers suggesting that they do this--close the exchange	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1324
At a few minutes before twelve o'clock he drove rapidly to the station to meet Stener	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1324
but to his great disappointment the latter did not arrive	O O O B-EMO I-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1324
It looked as though he had missed his train	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1324
Cowperwood sensed something	O O O	sadness	1324
some trick	O O	sadness	1324
and decided to go to the city hall and also to Stener's house	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1324
Perhaps he had returned and was trying to avoid him.	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1324
Stener	O	fear	1325
as he saw him now	O O O O O	fear	1325
was a pawn in whosoever's hands he happened to be at the time	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1325
and despite Mr	O O O	fear	1325

And so he stood there looking at him as might a snake at a bird determined to galvanize him into selfish self-interest if possible	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1325
But Stener was so frightened that at the moment it looked as though there was little to be done with him	O O O B-EMO I-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1325

as a matter of fact	O O O O O	fear	1332
his very financial blood was oozing away	O O O O O O O	fear	1332

his money	O O	fear	1332
as it was with his social and political standing in the community.	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1332
That was why he had been so ready to let Cowperwood act for him	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1333

After reaching his family he first motioned to his younger son (6yrs old) and they gave each other a long and loving hug	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1444

Everyone in family was shocked to hear that and didn’t knew what to do.	O O O O B-EMO O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1446
There was a girl who hated herself just because she was blind	O O O O O B-EMO O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	1448
She used to hate everyone around her except her Boyfriend	O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1448
He was always there for her even after the accident in which she got blind and her behavior changed towards life.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1448
Seeing her happy boyfriend was happy too and asked her	O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1450
“Now that you can see the world	O O O O O O O	surprise	1450

Jane	O	surprise	1452
I said	O O	surprise	1452

Now I realize that since I carried her into my home on our wedding day I am supposed to hold her until death do us apart.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1453
An old woman and 10 years old boy with school bag on his back were waiting for me	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1454
I treated the old lady first	O O O O O O	fear	1454

He was pale and shaking	O O O O B-EMO	fear	1454
He sat on the dental chair and pointed inside his mouth	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1454
"and said ""this is very painful""."	O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1454

My aunt died back in about 2003	O O O O O O O	sadness	1457
She was eighty-four and so was my uncle	O O O O O O O O	sadness	1457

My cousin talked him into selling the house that he and my aunt had built together about twenty-five years before	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1459
It was very hard to part with the home they built together	O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1459

my cousin and he saw a new house for sale	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1459
that was close to his business.	O O O O O O	sadness	1459
Rashi was a very sober kind of person and very soft spoken	O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1464
But to my astonishment	O O O B-EMO	surprise	1464
her answer was in the roughest possible way I had ever heard someone answering me.	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1464

Arti got angry with him and left for her father’s house.	O O B-EMO O O O O O O O O	anger	1470
She couldn’t accept thought of letting her mother-in-law die	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1471
She now started to worry about her mother-in-law health	O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1471
Thinking of same she went to her father’s house and asked him to give some medicine to cure her mother-in-law from the poison she had given her.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1471

instead she asked me softly	O O O O O	anger	1478
why	O	anger	1478
I avoided her question	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	1478
This made her angry	O O O B-EMO	anger	1478
She shouted at me	O O O O	anger	1478
± you are not a man	O O O O O O	anger	1478
They recognized him	O O O	fear	1481
but to their horror they also discovered something they didn抰 know	O O O B-EMO O O O O O O O	fear	1481
their son had only one arm and one leg.	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1481
It had been a year since Susan became blind	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	1482

Many loudly blamed the King for not keeping the roads clear	O O B-EMO O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	1483
but none did anything about getting the stone out of the way.	O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1483
As regards language	O O O	surprise	1484
versification	O	surprise	1484
and general spirit	O O O	surprise	1484
the matter is beyond controversy	O O O O O	surprise	1484
but when we come to consider the incidents of the story	O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1484
we find deviations from Homer even more serious than any of those from the Cyclic poets	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1484
And the strange thing is	O O B-EMO O O	surprise	1484
that each of these deviations is a manifest detriment to the perfection of his poem	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1484

a magnificent opportunity.	O O O	surprise	1484
In overweening exultation so Vaunted a Trojan	O O O O O O O	disgust	1485

there has been more difference of opinion.	O O O O O O O	happiness	1488
Now	O	fear	1489
it is just in describing such natural phenomena	O O O O O O O O	fear	1489
and in blending them with the turmoil of battle	O O O O O O O O O	fear	1489
that Quintus is in his element	O O O O O O	fear	1489
yet for such a scene he substitutes what is	O O O O O O O O O	fear	1489
by comparison	O O	fear	1489
a lame and impotent conclusion	O O O O O	fear	1489
Of that awful cry that rang over the sea heralding the coming of Thetis and the Nymphs to the death-rites of her son	O O B-EMO O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1489

Quintus is silent.	O O O	fear	1489
Again	O	fear	1490
"Homer (""Odyssey"" iv"	O O O	fear	1490

He told me he feared there was new design hatching@	O O O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1670
as if Monk had a mind to get into the saddle.	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1670
After that to the Admiralty	O O O O O	fear	1671

where my Lord told us that the University of Cambridge had a mind to choose him for their burgess	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1673
which he pleased himself with	O O B-EMO O O	happiness	1673
to think that they do look upon him as a thriving man	O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1673

The chief is that	O O O O	fear	1674

that the other will be forced to leave the House and fall in with General Monk	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1674

and so they will endeavour some more mischief.	O O O O O O O O	fear	1674

which gave great contentment to the gentlemen that were on board here	O O B-EMO I-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1680
and they said they would talk of it	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1680
when they come to Breda	O O O O O	happiness	1680
as not having it done yet in London so publickly.	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1680
In the afternoon my Lord and I walked together in the coach two hours	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1681
talking together upon all sorts of discourse: as religion	O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1681
wherein he is	O O O	disgust	1681
I perceive	O O	disgust	1681

I got into a boat and so into his barge My Lord almost transported with joy that he had done all this without any the least blur or obstruction in the world.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1682
Being with my Lord in the morning about business in his cabbin	O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1683
I took occasion to give him thanks for his love to me in the share that he had given me of his Majesty's money	O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1683

It was strange to see how all the people flocked together bare	O O B-EMO O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1684
to see the King looking out of the Council window	O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1684
At night my Lord told me how my orders that I drew last night about giving us power to act	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1684

This morning my brother Tom brought me my jackanapes coat with silver buttons	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1685
It rained this morning	O O O O	fear	1685

the King and Parliament being to be entertained by the City to-day with great pomp.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1685
My Lord and I upon our knees together took our oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1686
and the Oath of the Privy Seale	O O O O O O O	fear	1686
of which I was much glad	O O O O O O	fear	1686
though I am not likely to get anything by it at present	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1686
but I do desire it	O O O O O	fear	1686

An Oxford man	O O O	anger	1687
who spoke very much against the height of the now old clergy	O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1687
for putting out many of the religious fellows of Colleges	O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1687
and inveighing against them for their being drunk	O B-EMO O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	1687
It being post-night	O O O	anger	1687
I wrote to my Lord to give him notice that all things are well.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1687
I was much troubled	O O O O	fear	1688
for fear of being forced to pay the money myself	O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1688
Called at my father's going home	O O O O O O	fear	1688
and bespoke mourning for myself	O O B-EMO O O	fear	1688
for the death of the Duke of Gloucester.	O O O O O O O O	fear	1688
He seemed to be in a melancholy humour	O O O O O O O O	fear	1689
which	O	fear	1689
I was told by W	O O O O O	fear	1689
Howe	O	fear	1689
was for that he had lately lost a great deal of money at cards	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1689
which he fears he do too much addict himself to now-a-days.	O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1689
Chetwind told me that he did fear that this late business of the Duke of York's would prove fatal to my Lord Chancellor	O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1690

for the sale of two ships by an inch of candle (the first time that ever I saw any of this kind)	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1690
where I observed how they do invite one another	O O O O O O O O O	fear	1690
and at last how they all do cry	O O O O O O O O	fear	1690
and we have much to do to tell who did cry last.	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1690
I went with the Treasurer in his coach to White Hall	O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1691
and in our way	O O O O	anger	1691
in discourse	O O	anger	1691
do find him a very good-natured man	O O O O O O O	anger	1691
and	O	anger	1691
talking of those men who now stand condemned for murdering the King	O O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	1691
he says that he believes	O O O O O	anger	1691
that	O	anger	1691
if the law would give leave	O O O O O O	anger	1691
the King is a man of so great compassion that he would wholly acquit them.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1691
In the afternoon I went to White Hall	O O O O O O O O	surprise	1692
where I was surprised with the news of a plot against the King's person and my Lord Monk's	O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1692
and that since last night there were about forty taken up on suspicion.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1692
After dinner Mr	O O O	fear	1693
Shepley and I in private talking about my Lord's intentions to go speedily into the country	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1693
but to what end we know not	O O O O O O O	fear	1693
We fear he is to go to sea	O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1693
with his fleet now preparing	O O O O O	fear	1693
But we wish that he could get his 4000l.	O O O O O O O O O	fear	1693
Then in the Quire at the high altar	O O O O O O O O	sadness	1694
the King passed through all the ceremonies of the Coronation	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1694
which to my great grief I and most in the Abbey could not see The crowne being put upon his head	O O O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1694
a great shout begun	O O O O	sadness	1694
and he come forth to the throne	O O O O O O O	sadness	1694
and there passed through more ceremonies.	O O O O O O	sadness	1694
Though he gives me nothing at present till my father's death	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1695
or at least very little	O O O O O	happiness	1695
yet I am glad to see that he hath done so well for us all	O O O B-EMO O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1695

So that I was afraid the other would have too great a conquest over them Then to the Wardrobe	O O O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1696

and killed three of the French coach-horses and severall men	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1696
and is gone through the City next to our King's coach.	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1696
When it comes the next month to sit again	O O O O O O O O O	fear	1697
would bring trouble with it	O O O O O	fear	1697
and enquire how the King had disposed of offices and money	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1697
before they will raise more	O O O O O	fear	1697
which	O	fear	1697

Dined with Captain Lambert and his father-in-law	O O O O O O O	fear	1697

The greatest pains were afterwards taken to preserve the fortress	O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1698
and a fine Mole was constructed	O O O O O O	sadness	1698
at a vast expense	O O O O	sadness	1698
to improve the harbour.	O O O O	sadness	1698
At length	O O	disgust	1699
after immense sums of money had been wasted there	O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1699
the House of Commons expressed a dislike to the management of the garrison	O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	1699
which they suspected to be a nursery for a Popish army	O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1699
and seemed disinclined to maintain it any longer.	O O O O O O O O	disgust	1699
I am much troubled for it	O O B-EMO I-EMO O O	disgust	1700

But I do not see much true joy	O O O O O O O O	sadness	1701
but only an indifferent one	O O O O O	sadness	1701
in the hearts of the people	O O O O O O	sadness	1701
who are much discontented at the pride and luxury of the Court	O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1701

and a brief rest and respite from that cruelty on deck.	O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1726
For the first quarter of an hour	O O O O O O O	sadness	1727
in spite of the September chill	O O O O O O	sadness	1727
the sweat poured off me in streams	O O O O O O O	sadness	1727
And the course--well	O O O	sadness	1727
if was not steering	O O O O	sadness	1727
it was sculling	O O O	sadness	1727
the old bumboat was wobbling all around like a drunken tailor with two left legs	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1727
I fairly shook with apprehension lest the mate should come and look in the compass	O O O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1727
I had been accustomed to hard words if I did not steer within half a point each way.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1727
The third mate was nothing much but bad temper--not much sailor	O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1729

It was a splendid picture	O O O O O	happiness	1730
but--for the time--I felt glad I was not on board of her	O O O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1730
a very few minutes she was out of our ken	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1730
followed by the admiration of all.	O O O O O O	happiness	1730
We were all gathered about the fo'lk'sle scuttle one evening	O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1731
a few days after the gale referred to in the previous chapter	O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1731
and the question of whale-fishing came up for discussion	O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1731
Until that time	O O O	surprise	1731
strange as it may seem	B-EMO O O O O	surprise	1731
no word of this	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1731
the central idea of all our minds	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1731
had been mooted	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1731
ery man seemed to shun the subject	O O O O O O O	surprise	1731
although we were in daily expectation of being called upon to take an active part in whale-fighting.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1731
So we toiled watch and watch	O O O O O O	fear	1732
six hours on and six off	O O O O O O	fear	1732
the work never ceasing for an instant night or day Though the work was hard and dirty	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1732
and the discomfort of being so continually wet through with oil great	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1732
there was only one thing dangerous about the whole business That was the job of filling and shifting the huge casks of oil	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1732
Some of these were of enormous size	O O O O O O O	fear	1732
containing 350 gallons when full	O O O O O	fear	1732
and the work of moving them about the greasy deck of a rolling ship was attended with a terrible amount of risk.	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O B-EMO O O O	fear	1732
However	O	sadness	1733
the fact that the theft was discovered soon became painfully evident	O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O	sadness	1733
for we had a visit from the afterguard in force one afternoon	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1733
and Abner with his brewage was haled to the quarter-deck	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1733
There	O	sadness	1733
in the presence of all hands	O O O O O O	sadness	1733
he was arraigned	O O O	sadness	1733
found guilty of stealing the ship's stores	O O O O O O O	sadness	1733
and sentence passed upon him.	O O O O O	sadness	1733
Suddenly one of the men	O O O O O	happiness	1734
in lifting his net	O O O O	happiness	1734
slipped on the smooth bottom of the boat	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1734
jolting one of the oars	O O O O O	happiness	1734
There was a gleam of light below as the school turned--they had all disappeared instanter	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1734
We had been so busy that we had not noticed the dimensions of our catch	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1734
but now	O O	happiness	1734
to our great joy	O O B-EMO I-EMO	happiness	1734
we found that we had at least eight hundred fish nearly as large as herrings	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1734
We at once returned to the ship	O O O O O O O	happiness	1734
having been absent only two hours	O O O O O O	happiness	1734
during which we had caught sufficient to provide all hands with three good meals.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1734
Now	O	fear	1736
with us	O O	fear	1736
whenever the weather was doubtful or squally-looking	O O O O O O O	fear	1736
we shortened sail	O O O	fear	1736
and kept it fast till better weather came along	O O O O O O O O O	fear	1736
being quite careless whether we made one mile a day or one hundred	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1736
But just because nobody took any notice of our progress as the days passed	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1736
we were occasionally startled to find how far we had really got	O O O B-EMO O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1736
This was certainly the case with all of us forward	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1736
even to me who had some experience	O O O O O O O	fear	1736
so well used had I now become to the leisurely way of getting along.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1736
There were men in that forecastle as good citizens and as brave fellows as you would wish to meet--men who in their own sphere would have commanded and obtained respect	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1737
But under the painful and abnormal circumstances in which they found themselves--beaten and driven like dogs while in the throes of sea-sickness	O O O B-EMO O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1737
Half starved and hopeless	O O O O	sadness	1737
their spirit had been so broken	O O O O O O	sadness	1737
and they were so kept down to that sad level by the display of force	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1737
aided by deadly weapons aft	O O O O O	sadness	1737
that no other condition could be expected for them but that of broken-hearted slaves.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1737
We saw none	O O O	surprise	1738
however	O	surprise	1738
and at daylight we weighed and towed the ship out to sea with the boats	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1738
there being no wind	O O O O	surprise	1738
While busy at this uninteresting pastime	O O O O O O	surprise	1738
one of the boats slipped away	O O O O O O	surprise	1738
returning presently with a fine turtle	O O O O O O	surprise	1738
which they had surprised during his morning's nap	O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1738
e of the amphibious Portuguese slipped over the boat's side as she neared the sleeping SPHARGA	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1738
and	O	surprise	1738
diving deep	O O	surprise	1738
came up underneath him.	O O O O	surprise	1738
Down comes the black watcher from above with a swoop like an eagle	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1739
Booby puts all she knows into her flight	O O O O O O O O	sadness	1739
but vainly	O O	sadness	1739
Escape is impossible	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1739
so with a despairing shriek she drops her load.	O O O B-EMO O O O O O	sadness	1739
When we got on board we felt quite happy	O O O O O O O O B-EMO	happiness	1740
and	O	happiness	1740
for the first time since leaving America	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1740
we had a little singing	O O O O O	happiness	1740
all I be laughed at when I confess that our musical efforts were confined to Sankey's hymns	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1740
but as we secured five of them	O O O O O O O	happiness	1741
averaging seven barrels each	O O O O	happiness	1741
with scarcely any trouble	O O O O	happiness	1741
I felt quite pleased with myself	O O O O O O	happiness	1741
We had quite an exciting bit of sport with them	O O O O B-EMO O O O O O	happiness	1741
they were so lively.	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1741
The chief anxiety was for the safety of the boats	O O B-EMO O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1742
t as for danger--well	O O O O	fear	1742
"they only seemed like big ""black fish"" to us now"	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1742
and we quite enjoyed the fun.	O O O O O O	fear	1742
nor would any sane man falling across them run the risk of closer examination into details than we had done	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1743
It was a great pity that we were not able to sink the prahu with her ghastly cargo	O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1743
and so free the air from that poisonous foetor that was a deadly danger to any vessel getting under her lee	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1743
Next day	O O	sadness	1743
and for a whole week after	O O O O O O	sadness	1743
we had a stark calm such a calm as one realizes who reads sympathetically that magical piece of work	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1743
"the ""Ancient Mariner."""	O O O	sadness	1743
PLike some gigantic beacon	O O O O	happiness	1745

Our recent stay at the Cocos	O O O O O O	happiness	1745
however	O	happiness	1745
had settled the question of our calling anywhere else for some time decidedly in the negative	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1745
unless we might be compelled by accident	O O O O O O O	happiness	1745
Thinking that such a sight ought not to be missed by the captain	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1746
I overcame my dread of him sufficiently to call him	O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1746
and tell him of what was taking place	O O O O O O O O	anger	1746
He met my remarks with such a furious burst of anger at my daring to disturb him for such a cause	O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	1746
that I fled precipitately on deck again	O O O O O O O	anger	1746
having the remainder of the vision to myself	O O O O O O O O	anger	1746
for none of the others cared sufficiently for such things to lose five minutes' sleep in witnessing them	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1746
The conflict ceased	O O O	anger	1746
the sea resumed its placid calm	O O O O O O	anger	1746
and nothing remained to tell of the fight but a strong odour of fish	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1746
as of a bank of seaweed left by the tide in the blazing sun.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1746
Since leaving port we had not felt so comfortable	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1748
the work	O O	sadness	1748
with all its disagreeables	O O O O	sadness	1748
seeming as nothing now that we could do it without fear and trembling	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1748
Alas for poor Jemmy	O O B-EMO O	sadness	1748
--as we always persisted in calling him from inability to pronounce his proper name--his case was evidently hopeless	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1748
His fellows did their poor best to comfort his fast-fleeting hours	O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1748
one after another murmuring to him the prayers of the Church.	O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1748
Once clear of the southern end of Formosa we had quite a rapid run to the Bonins	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1749
carrying a press of sail day and night	O O O O O O O O	fear	1749
as the skipper was anxious to arrive there on account of his recent injuries	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1749
He was still very lame	O O O O O	fear	1749
and he feared that some damage might have been done to him of which he was ignorant	O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1749
Besides	O	fear	1749
it was easy to see that he did not altogether like anybody else being in charge of his ship	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1749
no matter how good they were.	O O O O O O	fear	1749
The chief was looking astern at some finbacks	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1750
the look-out men forward were both staring to leeward	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1750
thus for a minute or so I had a small arc of the horizon to myself	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1750

He was but just in time to bend on	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1751
when to our great delight we saw the end slip from our rival's boat	O O O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1751
This in no wise terminated his lien on the whale	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1751
supposing he could prove that he struck first	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1751
but it got him out of the way for the time.	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1751
Consequently the state of the ship was filthy	O O O O O O O O	anger	1752
nor could all our efforts keep her clean	O O O O O O O O	anger	1752
This farmyard condition of things was permitted to continue for about a week	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1752
when the officers got so tired of it	O O O O O O O O	anger	1752
and the captain so annoyed at the frequent loss of fowls by their flying overboard	O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	1752
that the edict went forth to feed the foremast hands on poultry till further orders	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1752
Great was our delight at the news.	O O O O O O O	anger	1752
You WANT somethin' to growl about	O O O O O O	anger	1753
you do	O O	anger	1753
""" Well"	O O	anger	1753
Cap'n George	O O	anger	1753

and could hardly restrain my indignation	O O O O O B-EMO	anger	1753
For in a dirty heap	O O O O O	anger	1753
the sight of which might have pleased an Esquimaux	O O O O O O O O O	anger	1753
but was certainly enough to disgust any civilized man	O O O O O O O O O	anger	1753
lay the calipee	O O O	anger	1753
or under- shell of the turtle	O O O O O O	anger	1753

But he gradually returned to his old self	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1754
to my great relief	O O O B-EMO	happiness	1754
and I ventured somewhat timidly to remind him of the esteem in which he was held by all hands	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1754
even the skipper	O O O	happiness	1754
I ventured to say	O O O O	happiness	1754
respected him	O O	happiness	1754
although	O	happiness	1754
from some detestable form of ill- humour	O O O O O O O	happiness	1754
he had chosen to be so sneering and insulting towards him.	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1754
As far as I could judge	O O O O O O	happiness	1755
they were the happiest of people	O O O B-EMO O O	happiness	1755
literally taking no thought for the morrow and content with the barest necessaries of life	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1755
so long as they were free and the sun shone brightly	O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1755
We had many opportunities of cultivating their acquaintance	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1755
for the captain allowed us much liberty	O O O O O O O	happiness	1755
quite one- half of the crew and officers being ashore most of the time.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1755
I felt sure	O O O	fear	1757
however	O	fear	1757
that we should have but little more trouble with our fish	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1757
In fact	O O	fear	1757
I was half afraid that he would die before getting to the surface	O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1757
in which case he might sink and be lost	O O O O O O O O O	fear	1757
We hauled steadily away	O O O O	fear	1757
the line not coming in very easily	O O O O O O O	fear	1757
until I judged there was only about another hundred fathoms out.	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1757
The fine haul we had obtained just previous to that day seemed to have exhausted our luck for the time being	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1758
for never a spout did we see	O O O O O O O	happiness	1758
And it was with no ordinary delight that we hailed the advent of an immense school of black-fish	O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1758
the first we had run across for a long time	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1758
Determined to have a big catch	O O O O O O	happiness	1758
if possible	O O	happiness	1758
we lowered all five boats	O O O O O	happiness	1758
as it was a beautifully calm day	O O O O O O O	happiness	1758
and the ship might almost safely have been left to look after herself.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1758
The accident was the fruit of gross carelessness	O O O O O O O O	surprise	1759
and should never have occurred	O O O O O	surprise	1759
But then	O O	surprise	1759
strange to say	B-EMO O O	surprise	1759
disasters to whale-boats are nearly always due to want of care	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1759
the percentage of unavoidable casualties being very small as compared with those like the one just related	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1759
When the highly dangerous nature of the work is remembered	O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1759
this statement may seem somewhat overdrawn	O O O O O O	surprise	1759
At that last titanic effort of his he had rushed downward with such terrific force that	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1760
striking his head on the bottom	O O O O O O	sadness	1760
he had broken his neck	O O O O O	sadness	1760
I felt very grieved that we had lost the chance of securing him	O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1760
but it was perfectly certain that before we could get help to raise him	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1760
all that would be left of his skeleton would be quite valueless to us	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1760
So with such patience as we could command we waited near the entrance until the receding ebb made it possible for us to emerge once more into the blessed light of day.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1760
Let it be so	O O O O	happiness	1761
For my part	O O O	happiness	1761
I rejoice that I have no tale of weeks of drunkenness	O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1761
of brutal rape	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1761
treacherous murder	B-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1761
and almost unthinkable torture to tell.	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1761
Why are good folks ashore systematically misled into the belief that the sailor is an object of charity	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1762
and that it is necessary to subscribe continually and liberally to provide him with food and shelter when ashore	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1762
"Most of the contributors would be surprised to know that the cost of board and lodging at the ""home"" is precisely the same as it is outside"	O O O O O O B-EMO O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1762
and much higher than a landsman of the same grade can live for in better style	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1762
With the exception of the sleeping accommodation	O O O O O O O	surprise	1762
most men prefer the boarding-house	O O O O O	surprise	1762
where	O	surprise	1762
"if they preserve the same commercial status which is a SINE QUA NON at the ""home"	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1762
""" they are treated like gentlemen"	O O O O O O	surprise	1762
While the final touch was being given to our task--i	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1763
the hole-boring through the tail-fin--all hands lay around in various picturesque attitudes	O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1763
enjoying a refreshing smoke	O O O O	sadness	1763
care forgetting	O O	sadness	1763
While thus pleasantly employed	O O O O	sadness	1763
sudden death	B-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1763
like a bolt from the blue	O O O O O O	sadness	1763
leapt into our midst in a terrible form	O O O O O O B-EMO O	sadness	1763
The skipper was labouring hard at his task of cutting the hole for the tow-line	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1763
when without warning the great fin swung back as if suddenly released from tremendous tension.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1763
A ruined house	O O O	surprise	1764
surrounded by other vestiges of what had once been a homestead	O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1764
stood in the middle of this piece of land	O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1764
Feeling curious to know what the history of this isolated settlement might be	O B-EMO O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1764
I asked the mate if he knew anything of it	O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1764
He told me that an American named Halstead	O O O O O O O O	surprise	1764
with his family	O O O	surprise	1764
lived here for years	O O O O	surprise	1764
visited only by an occasional whaler	O O O O O O	surprise	1764
to whom they sold such produce as they might have and be able to spare at the time.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1764
This was a novel experience for us in the CACHALOT	O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1765
and I was curious to see how she would behave	O O O B-EMO O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1765
To my mind	O O O	surprise	1765
"the supreme test of a ship's sea-kindliness is the length of time she will scud before a gale without ""pooping"" a sea"	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1765
or taking such heavy water on board over her sides as to do serious damage.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1765
Shall we take scorn instead of glory	O O O O O O O	surprise	1766
The Briton will marvel that he was conquered by men whom he sees fear is enough to conquer	O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1766
We struck them before with panic	O O O O O O	surprise	1766
shall we be panic-stricken by them	O O O O O O	surprise	1766
We scorned them when before us	O O O O O O	surprise	1766
Nothing of advantage to our cargo was seen for a long time	O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1767
which	O	surprise	1767
although apparently what was to be expected	O O O O O O O	surprise	1767
did not improve Captain Slocum's temper	O O O O O O	surprise	1767
But	O	surprise	1767
to the surprise of all	O O B-EMO O O	surprise	1767
when we had arrived off the beautiful island of Hong Kong	O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1767
to which we approached closely	O O O O O	surprise	1767
"we ""raised"" a grand sperm whale."	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1767
When morning dawned we hove-to	O O O O O	happiness	1769
the land being only dimly visible astern	O O O O O O O	happiness	1769
"and finished taking on board our ""head matter"" without further incident"	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1769
The danger past	O O O	happiness	1769
we were all well pleased that the captain was below	O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1769
for the work proceeded quite pleasantly under the genial rule of the mate	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1769
Since leaving port we had not felt so comfortable	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1769
the work	O O	happiness	1769
with all its disagreeables	O O O O	happiness	1769
seeming as nothing now that we could do it without fear and trembling.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1769
True	O	surprise	1770
the man was but a unit of no special note among us	O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1770
but death had conferred upon him a brevet rank	O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1770
in virtue of which be dominated every thought	O O O O O O O O	surprise	1770
It seemed strange to me that we who faced death so often and variously	O O B-EMO O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1770
until natural fear had become deadened by custom	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1770
should	O	surprise	1770
now that one of our number lay a rapidly-corrupting husk before us	O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1770
be so tremendously impressed by the simple	O O O O O O O	surprise	1770
inevitable fact.	O O	surprise	1770
None of your high art here	O O O O O O	surprise	1771
but haul in hand over hand	O O O O O O	surprise	1771
the line being strong enough to land a 250 pound fish	O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1771
Up he came	O O O	surprise	1771
the beauty	O O	surprise	1771
all silver and scarlet and blue	O O O O O O	surprise	1771
five feet long if an inch	O O O O O O	surprise	1771
and weighing 35 pounds	O O O O	surprise	1771
Well	O	surprise	1771
such a lot of astonished men I never saw	O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1771
They could hardly believe their eyes	O O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO	surprise	1771
That such a daring innovation should be successful was hardly to be believed	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O	surprise	1771
even with the vigorous evidence before them	O O O O O O O	surprise	1771
Even grim Captain Slocum came to look and turned upon me as I thought a less lowering brow than usual	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1771
while Mr	O O	surprise	1771
Count	O	surprise	1771
the mate	O O	surprise	1771
fairly chuckled again at the thought of how the little Britisher had wiped the eyes of these veteran fishermen.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1771
How did a whale act	O O O O O	disgust	1772
what were the first steps taken	O O O O O O	disgust	1772
what chance was there of being saved if your boat got smashed	O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1772
and so on unto infinity	O O O O O	disgust	1772
At last	O O	disgust	1772
"getting very tired of this ""Portugee Parliament"" of all talkers and no listeners"	O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	1772
I went aft to get a drink of water before turning in	O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1772
The harpooners and other petty officers were grouped in the waist	O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1772
earnestly discussing the pros and cons of attack upon whales.	O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1772
I said as cheerfully as I could	O O O O O O O	fear	1773
"""All right"	O O	fear	1773
sir	O	fear	1773
""" trying to look unconcerned"	O O O O O	fear	1773
telling myself not to be a coward	O O O O O O O	fear	1773

but the cold truth is that I was scared almost to death because I didn't know what was comingHowever	O O O O O O O O B-EMO O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1773
I did the best thing under the circumstances	O O O O O O O O	fear	1773
obeyed orders and looked steadily astern	O O O O O O	fear	1773
or up into the bronzed impassive face of my chief	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1773
who towered above me	O O O O	fear	1773
scanning with eagle eyes the sea ahead.	O O O O O O O	fear	1773
He raised a gigantic tail on high	O O O O O O O	anger	1774
threshing the water with deafening blows	O O O O O O	anger	1774
rolling at the same time from side to side until the surrounding sea was white with froth	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1774
I felt in an agony lest we should be crushed under one of those fearful strokes	O O O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	1774
for Mr	O O	anger	1774
Count appeared to be oblivious of possible danger	O O O O O O O O	anger	1774
although we seemed to be now drifting back on to the writhing leviathan	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1774
In the agitated condition of the sea	O O O O O O O	anger	1774
it was a task of no ordinary difficulty to unship the tall mast	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1774
which was of course the first thing to be done.	O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1774
So we toiled watch and watch	O O O O O O	fear	1775
six hours on and six off	O O O O O O	fear	1775
the work never ceasing for an instant night or day Though the work was hard and dirty	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1775
and the discomfort of being so continually wet through with oil great	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1775
there was only one thing dangerous about the whole business	O O O O O B-EMO O O O O	fear	1775
That was the job of filling and shifting the huge casks of oil	O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1775
Some of these were of enormous size	O O O O O O O	fear	1775
containing 350 gallons when full	O O O O O	fear	1775
and the work of moving them about the greasy deck of a rolling ship was attended with a terrible amount of risk.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1775
It will not	O O O	fear	1776
of course	O O	fear	1776
have escaped the reader's notice that I have not hitherto attempted to give any details concerning the structure of the whale just dealt with	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1776
The omission is intentional	O O O O	fear	1776
During this	O O	fear	1776
our first attempt at real whaling	O O O O O O	fear	1776
my mind was far too disturbed by the novelty and danger of the position in which I found myself for the first time	O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O O	fear	1776
for me to pay any intelligent attention to the party of the second part.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1776
We had been so busy that we had not noticed the dimensions of our catch	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1777
but now	O O	happiness	1777
to our great joy	O O B-EMO I-EMO	happiness	1777
we found that we had at least eight hundred fish nearly as large as herrings	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1777
We at once returned to the ship	O O O O O O O	happiness	1777
having been absent only two hours	O O O O O O	happiness	1777
during which we had caught sufficient to provide all hands with three good meals.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1777
He made a fearful to-do over it	O O O O O O O	happiness	1779
rolling completely over several times backward and forward	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1779
at the same time smiting the sea with his mighty tail	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1779
making an almost deafening noise and pother	O O O O O O O	happiness	1779
But we were comfortable enough	O O O B-EMO O	happiness	1779
while we unshipped the mast and made ready for action	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1779
being sufficiently far away from him to escape the full effect of his gambols.	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1779
During the conflict I had not noticed what now claimed attention-- several great masses of white	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1780
semi-transparent-looking substance floating about	O O O O	surprise	1780
of huge size and irregular shape	O O O O O O	surprise	1780
But one of these curious lumps came floating by as we lay	O O O O B-EMO O O O O O O O	surprise	1780
tugged at by several fish	O O O O O	surprise	1780
and I immediately asked the mate if he could tell me what it was and where it came from	O O O O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1780
He told me that	O O O O	surprise	1780
when dying	O O	surprise	1780
the cachalot always ejected the contents of his stomach	O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1780
which were invariably composed of such masses as we saw before us	O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1780
that he believed the stuff to be portions of big cuttle-fish	O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1780
bitten off by the whale for the purpose of swallowing	O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1780
but he wasn't sure	O O O O	surprise	1780
Anyhow	O	surprise	1780
I could haul this piece alongside now	O O O O O O O	surprise	1780
if I liked	O O O	surprise	1780
and see.	O O	surprise	1780
Anyhow	O	surprise	1781
I could haul this piece alongside now	O O O O O O O	surprise	1781
if I liked	O O O	surprise	1781
and see	O O	surprise	1781
Secretly wondering at the indifference shown by this officer of forty years' whaling experience to such a wonderful fact as appeared to be here presented	O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1781
I thanked him	O O O	surprise	1781
and	O	surprise	1781
sticking the boat-hook into the lump	O O O O O O	surprise	1781
drew it alongside.	O O O	surprise	1781
At seven bells (7	O O O O	disgust	1782
") it was ""turn to"" all hands again"	O O O O O O O O	disgust	1782
"The ""junk "" was hooked on to both cutting tackles"	O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1782
and the windlass manned by everybody who could get hold	O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1782
Slowly the enormous mass rose	O O O O O	disgust	1782
canting the ship heavily as it came	O O O O O O O	disgust	1782
while every stick and rope aloft complained of the great strain upon them	O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	1782
When at last it was safely shipped	O O O O O O O	disgust	1782
and the tackles cast off	O O O O O	disgust	1782
the size of this small portion of a full-grown cachalot's body could be realized	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1782
not before.	O O	disgust	1782
Here	O	disgust	1783
however	O	disgust	1783
we were better off than in an ordinary merchantman	O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1783
where doldrums are enough to drive you mad	O B-CAU O O O O O B-EMO	disgust	1783
The one object being to get along	O O O O O O O	disgust	1783
"it is incessant ""pully- hauly"	O O O O O	disgust	1783
""" setting and taking in sail"	O O O O O O	disgust	1783
in order	O O	disgust	1783
on the one hand	O O O O	disgust	1783
to lose no time	O O O O	disgust	1783
and	O	disgust	1783
on the other	O O O	disgust	1783
to lose no sails.	O O O O	disgust	1783
Now	O	fear	1784
with us	O O	fear	1784
whenever the weather was doubtful or squally-looking	O O O O O O O	fear	1784
we shortened sail	O O O	fear	1784
and kept it fast till better weather came along	O O O O O O O O O	fear	1784
being quite careless whether we made one mile a day or one hundred	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1784
But just because nobody took any notice of our progress as the days passed	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1784
we were occasionally startled to find how far we had really got	O O O B-EMO O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1784
This was certainly the case with all of us forward	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1784
even to me who had some experience	O O O O O O O	fear	1784
so well used had I now become to the leisurely way of getting along.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1784
With hearty cheers from the whole population	O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1785
we shoved off and ploughed through the kelp seaweed again	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1785
When we got clear of it	O O O O O O	happiness	1785
we found the swell heavier than when we had come	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1785
and a rough journey back to the ship was the result.	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1785
The men were afraid to go on to the sick-list	O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1786
Nothing short of total inability to continue would have prevented them from working	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1786
such was the terror with which that man had inspired us all	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1786
It may be said that we were a pack of cowards	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1786
who	O	fear	1786
without the courage to demand better treatment	O O O O O O O	fear	1786
deserved all we got.	O O O O	fear	1786
But under the painful and abnormal circumstances in which they found themselves--beaten and driven like dogs while in the throes of sea-sickness	O O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1787
half starved and hopeless	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1787
their spirit had been so broken	O O O O O B-EMO	sadness	1787
and they were so kept down to that sad level by the display of force	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1787
aided by deadly weapons aft	O O O O O	sadness	1787
that no other condition could be expected for them but that of broken-hearted slaves	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1787
My own case was many degrees better than that of the other whites	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1787
as I have before noted	O O O O O	sadness	1787
My own case was many degrees better than that of the other whites	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1788
as I have before noted	O O O O O	disgust	1788
but I was perfectly well aware that the slightest attempt on my part to show that I resented our common treatment would meet with the most brutal repression	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	1788
and	O	disgust	1788
in addition	O O	disgust	1788
I might look for a dreadful time of it for the rest of the voyage.	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	1788
The share of profits was so small	O O O O O O O	sadness	1789
and the time taken to earn it so long	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1789
such a number of clothes were worn out and destroyed by us	O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1789
only to be replaced from the ship's slop-chest at high prices	O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1789
that I had quite resigned myself to the prospect of leaving the vessel in debt	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1789
whenever that desirable event might happen	O O O O O O	sadness	1789
Since	O	sadness	1789
therefore	O	sadness	1789
I had never made it a practice to repine at the inevitable	O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1789
and make myself unhappy by the contemplation of misfortunes I was powerless to prevent	O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O	sadness	1789
I tried to interest myself as far as was possible in gathering information	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1789
although at that time I had no idea	O O O O O O O O	sadness	1789
beyond a general thirst for knowledge	O O O O O O	sadness	1789
that what I was now learning would ever he of any service to me.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1789
The weather of the Mozambique Channel was fairly good	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1791
although subject to electric storms of the most terrible aspect	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O B-EMO O	sadness	1791
but perfectly harmless	O O O	sadness	1791
On the second evening after rounding Cape St	O O O O O O O O	sadness	1791
Mary	O	sadness	1791
we were proceeding	O O O	sadness	1791
as usual	O O	sadness	1791
under very scanty sail	O O O O	sadness	1791
rather enjoying the mild	O O O O	sadness	1791
balmy air	O O	sadness	1791
scent-laden	O	sadness	1791
from Madagascar.	O O	sadness	1791
There was no thunder	O O O O	sadness	1792
but a low hissing and a crackling which did not amount to noise	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1792
although distinctly audible to all	O O O O O	sadness	1792
Sensations most unpleasant of pricking and general irritat were felt by every one	O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1792
according to their degree of susceptibility.	O O O O O O	sadness	1792
We saw none	O O O	surprise	1793
however	O	surprise	1793
and at daylight we weighed and towed the ship out to sea with the boats	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1793
there being no wind	O O O O	surprise	1793
While busy at this uninteresting pastime	O O O O O O	surprise	1793
one of the boats slipped away	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1793
returning presently with a fine turtle	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1793
which they had surprised during his morning's nap	O O O B-EMO O O O O	surprise	1793
One of the amphibious Portuguese slipped over the boat's side as she neared the sleeping SPHARGA	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1793
and	O	surprise	1793
diving deep	O O	surprise	1793
came up underneath him	O O O O	surprise	1793
seizing with crossed hands the two hind flippers.	O O O O O O O O	surprise	1793
Doubtless because he himself was much fatigued	O O O O O O O	happiness	1795
the mate allowed him to run at his will	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1795
without for the time attempting to haul any closer to him	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1795
and very grateful the short rest was to us	O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1795
But he had not gone a couple of miles before he turned a complete somersault in the water	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1795
coming up BEHIND us to rush off again in the opposite direction at undiminished speed.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1795
Up till now we had not succeeded in getting home a single lance	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1796
the foe was becoming warier	O O O O O	sadness	1796
while the strain was certainly telling upon our nerves	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1796
So Mr	O O	sadness	1796
Count got out his bomb-gun	O O O O O	sadness	1796
shouting at the same time to Mr	O O O O O O O	sadness	1796
Cruce to do the same	O O O O O	sadness	1796
They both hated these weapons	O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1796
nor ever used them if they could help it	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1796
but what was to be done	O O O O O O	sadness	1796
We got the whale cut in as usual without any incident worth mentioning	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1797
except that the peculiar shape of the jaw made it an object of great curiosity to all of us who were new to the whale- fishing	O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O B-EMO O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1797
Such malformations are not very rare	O O O O O O	surprise	1797
They are generally thought to occur when the animal is young	O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1797
and its bones soft	O O O O	surprise	1797
As soon as they had got far enough away from their native element	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1798
we rushed upon them	O O O O	happiness	1798
and captured them both	O O O O	happiness	1798
so that when the boat arrived we were not empty-handed	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1798
"We had also a ""jumper"	O O O O O	happiness	1798
""" or blouse"	O O O	happiness	1798
full of eggs	O O O	happiness	1798
and a couple of immense bunches of cocoa-nuts	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1798
When we got on board we felt quite happy	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O B-EMO	happiness	1798
and	O	happiness	1798
for the first time since leaving America	O O O O O O O	happiness	1798
we had a little singing	O O O O O	happiness	1798
Shall I be laughed at when I confess that our musical efforts were confined to Sankey's hymns	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1798
It was but a school of kogia	O O O O O O O	happiness	1799
"or ""short-headed"" cachalots"	O O O	happiness	1799
but as we secured five of them	O O O O O O O	happiness	1799
averaging seven barrels each	O O O O	happiness	1799
with scarcely any trouble	O O O O	happiness	1799
I felt quite pleased with myself	O O O O O O	happiness	1799
We had quite an exciting bit of sport with them	O O O O B-EMO O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1799
they were so lively	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1799
but as for danger--well	O O O O	happiness	1799
"they only seemed like big ""black fish"" to us now"	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1799
and we quite enjoyed the fun.	O O O O O O	happiness	1799
The chief anxiety was for the safety of the boats	O O B-EMO O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1800
Early on the second day of warning they had been hoisted to the topmost notch of the cranes	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1800
and secured as thoroughly as experience could suggest	O O O O O O O O	fear	1800
The terrible day wore on	O B-EMO O O O	sadness	1801
without any lightening of the tempest	O O O O O O	sadness	1801
till noon	O O	sadness	1801
when the wind suddenly fell to a calm	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1801
Until that time	O O O	sadness	1801
the sea	O O	sadness	1801
although heavy	O O	sadness	1801
was not vicious or irregular	O O O O O	sadness	1801
and we had not shipped any heavy water at all.	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1801
In two minutes we were speeding away towards her	O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1802
and	O	disgust	1802
making a sweep round her stern	O O O O O O	disgust	1802
prepared to board her	O O O O	disgust	1802
But we were met by a stench so awful that Mr	O O O O O O B-CAU O B-EMO O O	disgust	1802
Count would not proceed	O O O O	disgust	1802
and at once returned to the ship	O O O O O O O	disgust	1802
The boat was quickly hoisted again	O O O O O O	disgust	1802
and the ship manoeuvred to pass close to windward of the derelict.	O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1802
whatever it was	O O O	sadness	1804
it had been complete	O O O O	sadness	1804
nor would any sane man falling across them run the risk of closer examination into details than we had done	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1804
It was a great pity that we were not able to sink the prahu with her ghastly cargo	O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1804
and so free the air from that poisonous foetor that was a deadly danger to any vessel getting under her lee.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1804
Next day	O O	surprise	1805
and for a whole week after	O O O O O O	surprise	1805
we had a stark calm such a calm as one realizes who reads sympathetically that magical piece of work	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1805
"the ""Ancient Mariner"""	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1805
What an amazing instance of the triumph of the human imagination	O O B-EMO O O O O O O O O	surprise	1805
What an amazing instance of the triumph of the human imagination	O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1806
For Coleridge certainly never witnessed such a scene as he there describes with an accuracy of detail that is astounding	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O B-EMO	surprise	1806
Very few sailors have noticed the sickening condition of the ocean when the life-giving breeze totally fails for any length of time	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1806
or	O	surprise	1806
if they have	O O O	surprise	1806
they have said but little about it.	O O O O O O O	surprise	1806
A light breeze then sprang up	O O O O O O	happiness	1807
aided by which we crept around Achin Head	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1807
the northern point of the great island of Sumatra	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1807
Like some gigantic beacon	O O O O	happiness	1807
the enormous mass of the Golden Mountain dominated the peaceful scene	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1807
Pulo Way	O O	happiness	1807
or Water Island	O O O	happiness	1807
looked very inviting	O O O	happiness	1807
and I should have been glad to visit a place so well known to seamen by sight	O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1807
but so little known by actual touching at	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1807
Our recent stay at the Cocos	O O O O O O	happiness	1807
however	O	happiness	1807
had settled the question of our calling anywhere else for some time decidedly in the negative	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1807
unless we might be compelled by accident	O O O O O O O	happiness	1807
Therefore	O	sadness	1808
we had all a rough time of it while his angry fit lasted	O O O O B-EMO O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1808
which was a whole week	O O O O O	sadness	1808
or until all was shipshape again	O O O O O O	sadness	1808
Meanwhile we were edging gradually through the Malacca Straits and around the big island of Borneo	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1808
never going very near the land on account of the great and numerous dangers attendant upon coasting in those localities to any but those continually engaged in such a business.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1808
The sorely wounded monster	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1809
with one tremendous expiration	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1809
rolled over and over swift as thought towards his aggressor	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1809
literally burying the boat beneath his vast bulk	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1809
Now	O	surprise	1809
one would have thought surely	O O O O O	surprise	1809
upon seeing this	O O O	surprise	1809
that none of that boat's crew would ever have been seen again	O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1809
Nevertheless	O	surprise	1809
strange as it may appear	B-EMO O O O O	surprise	1809
out of that seething lather of foam	O O O O O O O	surprise	1809
all six heads emerged again in an instant	O O O O O O O O	surprise	1809
but on the OTHER side of the great creature.	O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1809
The truth of Mr	O O O O	sadness	1810
Count's forecast was verified to the hilt	O O O O O O O	sadness	1810
for we found that the captain was so badly bruised about	O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1810
the body that he was unable to move	O O O O O O O O	sadness	1810
while one of the hands	O O O O O	sadness	1810
a Portuguese	O O	sadness	1810
was injured internally	O O O	sadness	1810
and seemed very bad indeed	O O O O O	sadness	1810
Had any one told us that morning that we should be sorry to see Captain Slocum with sore bones	O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1810
we should have scoffed at the notion	O O O O O O O	sadness	1810
and some of us would probably have said that we should like to have the opportunity of making him smart.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1810
Once clear of the southern end of Formosa we had quite a rapid run to the Bonins	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1811
carrying a press of sail day and night	O O O O O O O O	fear	1811
as the skipper was anxious to arrive there on account of his recent injuries	O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1811
He was still very lame	O O O O O	fear	1811
and he feared that some damage might have been done to him of which he was ignorant.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1811
Once clear of the southern end of Formosa we had quite a rapid run to the Bonins	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1812
carrying a press of sail day and night	O O O O O O O O	fear	1812
as the skipper was anxious to arrive there on account of his recent injuries	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1812
He was still very lame	O O O O O	fear	1812
and he feared that some damage might have been done to him of which he was ignorant	O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1812
Besides	O	fear	1812
it was easy to see that he did not altogether like anybody else being in charge of his ship	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1812
no matter how good they were.	O O O O O O	fear	1812
They were abusing him through all the varied gamut of filthy language they possessed	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1813
My democratic sentiments are deeply seated	O O O O O O	fear	1813
but I do believe in authority	O O O O O O	fear	1813
and respect for it being rigidly enforced	O O O O O O O	fear	1813
so this uncalled-for scene upset me	O O B-CAU I-CAU B-EMO O	fear	1813
making me feel anxious that the gibbering fools might get a lesson	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1813
They got one.	O O O	fear	1813
they were abusing him through all the varied gamut of filthy language they possessed	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1814
My democratic sentiments are deeply seated	O O O O O O	fear	1814
but I do believe in authority	O O O O O O	fear	1814

so this uncalled-for scene upset me	O O O O O O	fear	1814
making me feel anxious that the gibbering fools might get a lesson	O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1814
They got one.	O O O	fear	1814
As I bent to my oar	O O O O O O	sadness	1815
I felt very sorry for what had happened	O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1815
Here were half the crew guilty of an act of violence upon an officer	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1815
which	O	sadness	1815
according to the severe code under which we lived	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1815
merited punishment as painful as could be inflicted	O O O O O O O O	sadness	1815
and lasting for the rest of the voyage.	O O O O O O O O	sadness	1815
This sort of thing was right in his line	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1817
Naturally cruel	O O	happiness	1817
he seemed to thoroughly enjoy himself in the prospect of making human beings twist and writhe in pain	O O O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1817
Nor would he be baulked of a jot of his pleasure.	O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO	happiness	1817
Not seeing what had happened to his iron	O O O O O O O O	fear	1819
or knowing that we were fast	O O O O O O	fear	1819
the other harpooner promptly hurled his second iron	O O O O O O O O	fear	1819
which struck solidly	O O O	fear	1819
It was a very pretty tangle	O O O O O O	fear	1819
but our position was rather bad	O B-CAU I-CAU O O B-EMO	fear	1819
The whale between us was tearing the bowels of the deep up in his rage and fear	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1819
we were struggling frantically to get our sail down	O O O O O O O O O	fear	1819
and at any moment that wretched iron through our upper strake might tear a plank out of us.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1819
It was a very pretty tangle	O O O O O O	anger	1820
but our position was rather bad	O B-CAU I-CAU O O O	anger	1820
The whale between us was tearing the bowels of the deep up in his rage and fear	O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O B-EMO O O	anger	1820
we were struggling frantically to get our sail down	O O O O O O O O O	anger	1820
and at any moment that wretched iron through our upper strake might tear a plank out of us.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1820
Our chief	O O	happiness	1821
foaming at the mouth with rage and excitement	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1821
was screeching inarticulate blasphemy at the other mate	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1821
who	O	happiness	1821
not knowing what was the matter	O O O O O O	happiness	1821
was yelling back all his copious vocabulary of abuse	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1821
I felt very glad the whale was between us	O O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1821
or there would surely have been murder done	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1821
At last	O O	happiness	1821
out drops the iron	O O O O	happiness	1821
leaving a jagged hole you could put your arm through	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1821
Wasn't Mr	O O	happiness	1821
Count mad	O O	happiness	1821
Wasn't Mr	O O	anger	1822
Count mad	O O	anger	1822
I really thought he would split with rage	O O O O O O O B-EMO	anger	1822
for it was impossible for us to go on with that hole in our bilge	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	1822
The second mate came alongside and took our line as the whale was just commencing to sound	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1822
thus setting us free.	O O O O	anger	1822
And still the whale kept going steadily down	O O O O O O O O	disgust	1823
down	O	disgust	1823
down	O	disgust	1823
Already he was on the second boat's lines	O O O O O O O O	disgust	1823
and taking them out faster than ever	O O O O O O O	disgust	1823
Had we been alone	O O O O	disgust	1823
this persistence on his part	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	1823
though annoying	O B-EMO	disgust	1823
would not have mattered much	O O O O O	disgust	1823
but	O	disgust	1823
with so many others in company	O O O O O O	disgust	1823
the possibilities of complication	O O O O	disgust	1823
should we need to slip our end	O O O O O O O	disgust	1823
were numerous.	O O	disgust	1823
When I recovered	O O O	happiness	1825
I was snug in my bunk aboard	O O O O O O O	happiness	1825
but aching in every joint	O O O O O	happiness	1825
and as sore as if I had been pounded with a club until I was bruised all over	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1825
During the day Mr	O O O O	happiness	1825
Count was kind enough to pay me a visit	O O B-EMO O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1825
With his usual luck	O O O O	happiness	1825
he had escaped without the slightest injury	O O O O O O O	happiness	1825
Consequently the state of the ship was filthy	O O O O O O O O	anger	1826
nor could all our efforts keep her clean	O O O O O O O O	anger	1826
This farmyard condition of things was permitted to continue for about a week	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1826
when the officers got so tired of it	O O O O O O O O	anger	1826
and the captain so annoyed at the frequent loss of fowls by their flying overboard	O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	1826
that the edict went forth to feed the foremast hands on poultry till further orders.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1826
When I told Samuela	O O O O	fear	1827
of his chance	O O O	fear	1827
he was beside himself with joy	O O O O O O	fear	1827
As to his being scared	O O O O B-EMO	fear	1827
the idea was manifestly absurd	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1827
He was as pleased with the prospect as it was possible for a man to be	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1827
and hardly able to contain himself for impatience to be off.	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1827
Two and a half hours of energetic work was required of us before we got on terms with the fleeing monsters	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1829
but at last	O O O	surprise	1829
to our great joy	O O O O	surprise	1829
they broke water from sounding right among us	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1829
It was a considerable surprise	O O O O B-EMO	surprise	1829
but we were all ready	O O O O O	surprise	1829
and before they had spouted twice	O O O O O O	surprise	1829
three boats were fast	O O O O	surprise	1829
only myself keeping out	O O O O	surprise	1829
in accordance with my instructions.	O O O O O	surprise	1829
It was a considerable surprise	O O O O O	disgust	1830
but we were all ready	O O O O O	disgust	1830
and before they had spouted twice	O O O O O O	disgust	1830
three boats were fast	O O O O	disgust	1830
only myself keeping out	O O O O	disgust	1830
in accordance with my instructions	O O O O O	disgust	1830
Samuela was almost distraught with rage and grief at the condition of things	O O O B-EMO O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	1830
I quite pitied him	O O O O	disgust	1830
although I was anything but pleased myself.	O O O O O O O	disgust	1830
Thenceforward for another hour	O O O O	disgust	1831
in spite of all our efforts	O O O O O O	disgust	1831
we could not get within striking distance	O O O O O O O	disgust	1831
mainly because of the close attention of the cow	O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1831
which stuck to her lord like a calf to its mother	O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1831
I was getting so impatient of this hindrance	O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU	disgust	1831
that it was all I could do to restrain myself from lancing the cow	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1831
though I felt convinced that	O O O O O	disgust	1831
if I did	O O O	disgust	1831
I should spoil a good job.	O O O O O O	disgust	1831
We took them on board	O O O O O	fear	1832
and the boat returned again	O O O O O	fear	1832
By the time the slack came we had about four hundred and fifty fathoms out--a goodly heap to pile up loose in our stern-sheets	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1832
I felt sure	O O O	fear	1832
however	O	fear	1832
that we should have but little more trouble with our fish	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1832
in fact	O O	fear	1832
I was half afraid that he would die before getting to the surface	O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1832
in which case he might sink and be lost	O O O O O O O O O	fear	1832
We hauled steadily away	O O O O	fear	1832
the line not coming in very easily	O O O O O O O	fear	1832
until I judged there was only about another hundred fathoms out.	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1832
The ceaseless motion of the vessel rocking at the centre of a circular space of blue	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1833
with a perfectly symmetrical dome of azure enclosing her above	O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1833
unflecked by a single cloud	O O O O O	anger	1833
becomes at last almost unbearable from its changeless sameness of environment	O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1833
Were it not for the trivial round and common task of everyday ship duty	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1833
some of the crew must become idiotic	O O O O O O O	anger	1833
or	O	anger	1833
in sheer rage at the want of interest in their lives	O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	1833
commit mutiny.	B-CAU I-CAU	anger	1833
The accident was the fruit of gross carelessness	O O O O O O O O	surprise	1835
and should never have occurred	O O O O O	surprise	1835
but then	O O	surprise	1835
strange to say	B-EMO O O	surprise	1835
disasters to whale-boats are nearly always due to want of care	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1835
the percentage of unavoidable casualties being very small as compared with those like the one just related.	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1835
for his first move was to come straight for me with a furious rush	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1836
carrying the war into the enemy's country with a vengeance It must be remembered that I was but young	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1836
and a comparatively new hand at this sort of thing	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1836
so when I confess that I felt more than a little scared at this sudden change in the tactics of my opponent	O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1836
I hope I shall be excusedRemembering	O O O O O O	fear	1836
however	O	fear	1836
that all our lives depended on keeping cool	O O O O O O O O	fear	1836
I told myself that even if I was frightened I must not go all to pieces	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1836
but compel myself to think and act calmly	O O O O O O O O	fear	1836
since I was responsible for others If the animal had not been in so blind a fury	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1836
I am afraid my task would have been much harder	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1836
so when I confess that I felt more than a little scared at this sudden change in the tactics of my opponent	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1837

I am afraid my task would have been much harder	O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1837
but he was mad	O O O O	fear	1837
and his savage rushes were	O O O O O	fear	1837
though disquieting	O O	fear	1837
unsystematic and clumsy.	O O O	fear	1837
I put my hand out to help myself to a sitting posture	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1839
and touched blubber	O B-CAU I-CAU	fear	1839
That startled me so that I sprung up as if shot	O B-EMO O O O O O O O O O	fear	1839
Then I took in the situation at a glance.	O O O O O O O O O	fear	1839
Samuela and Polly set to work with their sheath-knives	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1840
and soon excavated a space in the blubber to enable them to reach the meat	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1840
Then they cut off some good-sized junks	O O O O O O O	happiness	1840
and divided it up	O O O O	happiness	1840
It was not half bad	O O O O O	happiness	1840
and as we chewed on the tough black fibre	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1840
I could hardly help smiling as I thought how queer a Christmas dinner we were having	O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1840
But eating soon heightened our thirst	O O O O O O	happiness	1840
and our real sufferings then began.	O O O O O O	happiness	1840
The captain shook hands with me cordially	O O O O O O O	happiness	1841
pooh-poohing the loss of the boat as an unavoidable incident of the trade	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1841
but expressing his heart-felt delight at getting us all back safe	O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1841
The whale we had killed was ample compensation for the loss of several boats	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1841
though such was the vigour with which the sharks were going for him	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1841
that it was deemed advisable to cut in at once	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1841
working all night.	O O O	happiness	1841
We who had been rescued	O O O O O	sadness	1842
however	O	sadness	1842
were summarily ordered below by the skipper	O O O O O O O	sadness	1842
and forbidden	O O	sadness	1842
on pain of his severe displeasure	O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1842
to reappear until the following morning	O O O O O O	sadness	1842
This great privilege we gladly availed ourselves of	O O O O O O O O	sadness	1842
awaking at daylight quite well and fit	O O O O O O O	sadness	1842
not a bit the worse for our queer experience of the previous day.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1842
For unto us a Child is born	O O O O O O O	surprise	1843
"unto us a Son is given""--again and again--billows and billows of glory"	O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1843
I gasped for breath	O O O O	surprise	1843
shook like one in an ague fit	O O O O O O O	surprise	1843
the tears ran down in a continuous stream	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1843
while people stared amazed at me	O O O B-EMO O O	surprise	1843
thinking	O	surprise	1843
I suppose	O O	surprise	1843
that I was another drunken sailor.	O O O O O O	surprise	1843
I have no doubt whatever that some of the gentry who swear at large about the evils of missionaries would have been loud in their disgust at the entire absence of drink and debauchery	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	1844
and the prevalence of what they would doubtless characterize as adjective hypocrisy on the part of the natives	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	1844
but no decent man could help rejoicing at the peace	O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1844
the security	O O	disgust	1844
and friendliness manifested on every hand	O O O O O O	disgust	1844
nor help awarding unstinted praise to whoever had been the means of bringing about so desirable a state of things.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1844
but ten thousand times better thus than such scenes of lust let loose and abandoned animalism as we witnessed at Honolulu	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1845
What pleased me mightily was the absence of the white man with his air of superiority and sleek overlordship	O B-EMO O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1845
All the worship	O O O	happiness	1845
all the management of affairs	O O O O O	happiness	1845
was entirely in the hands of the natives themselves	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1845
and excellently well did they manage everything.	O O O O O O O	happiness	1845
What a sigh	O O O	happiness	1846
One looked at the other inquiringly	O O O O O O	happiness	1846
but the repetition of that long expiration satisfied us all that it was the placid breathing of the whale we sought somewhere close at hand	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU B-EMO O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1846
The light grew rapidly better	O O O O O	happiness	1846
and we strained our eyes in every direction to discover the whereabouts of our friend	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1846
but	O	happiness	1846
for some minutes without result.	O O O O O	happiness	1846
News of our coming had preceded us	O O O O O O O	happiness	1847
and the whole native population appeared to be afloat to make us welcome	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1847
The air rang again with their shouts of rejoicing	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1847
for our catch represented to them a gorgeous feast	O B-CAU I-CAU O O O O B-EMO I-EMO	happiness	1847
such as they had not indulged in for many a day	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1847
The flesh of the humpbacked whale is not at all bad	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1847
being but little inferior to that of the porpoise	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1847
That being settled	O O O	disgust	1848
we anchored the boat	O O O O	disgust	1848
and lit pipes	O O O	disgust	1848
preparatory to passing as comfortable a night as might be under the circumstances	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1848
the only thing troubling me being the anxiety of the skipper on our behalf	O O O B-EMO O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	1848
Presently the blackness beneath was lit up by a wide band of phosphoric light	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1848
shed in the wake of no ordinary-sized fish	O O O O O O O O	disgust	1848
probably an immense shark.	O O O O	disgust	1848
But we lost no time in getting back to the ship	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1849
where I fully expected a severe wigging for the scrape my luckless curiosity had led me into	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1849
The captain	O O	happiness	1849
however	O	happiness	1849
was very kind	O O O	happiness	1849
expressing his pleasure at seeing us all safe back again	O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1849
although he warned me solemnly against similar investigations in future	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1849
A hearty meal and a good rest did wonders in removing the severe effects of our adventure	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1849
so that by next morning we were all fit and ready for the days work again.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1849
But	O	surprise	1850
alas for the fruit of our labours	O O O O O O O	surprise	1850
Those hungry monsters had collected in thousands	O O O O O O O	surprise	1850
and	O	surprise	1850
to judge from what we were able to see of the body	O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1850
they had reduced its value alarmingly	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU B-EMO	surprise	1850
However	O	surprise	1850
we commenced towing	O O O	surprise	1850
and were getting along fairly well	O O O O O O	surprise	1850
when a long spur of reef to leeward of us	O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1850
over which the sea was breaking frightfully	O O O O O O O	surprise	1850
seemed to be stretching farther out to intercept us before we could get into smooth water.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1850
Taking stock of him quietly during our day-long leisurely cruises in the boat	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1851
I often wondered whether his mind still kept its gloomy forebodings	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1851
and brooded over his tragical life-history	O O O O O O	fear	1851
I never dared to speak to him on the subject	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1851
for fear of arousing what I hoped was growing too faint for remembrance	O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1851

Our Kanakas	O O	disgust	1863

the flood of feeling undammed by that odorous breath	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1864

Why	O	happiness	1883
when he does a good thing he's nothing but a boy	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1883
he's so glad about it	O O B-EMO O O	happiness	1883
"I always know how his work has gone when I see his face."""	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1883
not only on his own account but on hers and his father's	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1884
In her tenderness she had not told him that the real reason was his instability of purpose	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1884
fearing to wound his pride	B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1884
she had put it solely on the ground of his settling down to some work.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1884
Frode was thus forced to quit the wars of the East and fought a great battle in Sweden with his sister Swanhwid	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1885
in which he was beaten	O O O O O	surprise	1885
So he got on board a skiff	O O O O O O O	surprise	1885
and sailed stealthily in a circuit	O O O O O O	surprise	1885
seeking some way of boring through the enemy's fleet	O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1885
When surprised by his sister and asked why he was rowing silently and following divers meandering courses	O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1885
he cut short her inquiry by a similar question	O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1885
When he had done these things	O O O O O O	happiness	1886
and gone back to his own land	O O O O O O O	happiness	1886
one Skat entertained him at a banquet	O O O O O O O	happiness	1886
desirous to mingle his toilsome warfare with joyous licence	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1886
Frode was lying in his house	O O O O O O	happiness	1886
in royal fashion	O O O	happiness	1886
upon cushions of cloth of gold	O O O O O O	happiness	1886
and a certain Hunding challenged him to fight	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1886
Then	O	happiness	1886
though he had bent his mind to the joys of wassail	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1886
he had more delight in the prospect of a fray than in the presence of a feast	O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O	happiness	1886
and wound up the supper with a duel and the duel with a triumph.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1886
Now Urse	O O	fear	1887
who had watched her chance for the deed of guile	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1887
on the third day of the banquet	O O O O O O O	fear	1887
without her husband ever dreaming of such a thing	O O O O O O O O O	fear	1887
put all the king's wealth into carriages	O O O O O O O	fear	1887
and going out stealthily	O O O O	fear	1887
stole away from her own dwelling and fled in the glimmering twilight	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1887
departing with her son	O O O O	fear	1887
Thrilled with fear of her husband's pursuit	O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1887
and utterly despairing of escape beyond	O O O O O O	fear	1887
she begged and bade her companions to cast away the money	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1887
declaring that they must lose either life or riches	O O O O O O O O O	fear	1887
the short and only path to safety lay in flinging away the treasure	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1887
nor could any aid to escape be found save in the loss of their possessions.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1887
So Athisl	O O	happiness	1888
when he saw the necklace that he had given to Rolf left among the other golden ornaments	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1888
gazed fixedly upon the dearest treasure of his avarice	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1888
and	O	happiness	1888
in order to pick up the plunder	O O O O O O O	happiness	1888
glued his knees to the earth and deigned to stoop his royalty unto greed	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1888
Rolf	O	happiness	1888
seeing him lie abjectly on his face in order to gather up the money	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1888
smiled at the sight of a man prostrated by his own gifts	B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1888
just as if he were seeking covetously to regain what he had craftily yielded up	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1888
The Swedes were content with their booty	O O O O O O O	happiness	1888
and Rolf quickly retired to his ships	O O O O O O O	happiness	1888
and managed to escape by rowing violently.	O O O O O O O	happiness	1888
If thou refuse thy daughter	O O O O O	happiness	1889
consent to fight: thou must needs grant one thing or the other We wish either to die or to have our prayers beard Something -- sorrow if not joy -- we will get from thee Frode will be better pleased to hear of our slaughter than of our repulse	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O	happiness	1889
Without another word	O O O	happiness	1889
he threatened to aim a blow at the king's throat with his sword The king replied that it was unseemly for the royal majesty to meet an inferior in rank in level combat	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1889
and unfit that those of unequal station should fight as equals.	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1889
They found that Ragnar was dead	O O O O O O	fear	1891
and that Kraka had already married one Brak	O O O O O O O O	fear	1891
Then they remembered the father's treasure	O O O O O O	fear	1891
dug up the money	O O O O	fear	1891
and bore it off	O O O O	fear	1891
But Erik's fame had gone before him	O O O O O O O	fear	1891
and Gotar had learnt all his good fortune	O O O O O O O O	fear	1891
Now when Gotar learnt that he had come himself	O O O O O O O O O	fear	1891
he feared that his immense self-confidence would lead him to plan the worst against the Norwegians	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1891
and was anxious to take his wife from him and marry him to his own daughter in her place: for his queen had just died	O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O	fear	1891
and he was anxious to marry the sister of Frode more than anyone.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1891
They were Goliath and the skipper	O O O O O O	sadness	1893
Captain Slocum's right hand went naturally to his hip pocket	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1893
where he always carried a revolver	O O O O O O	sadness	1893
but before he could draw it	O O O O O O	sadness	1893
the long	B-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1893
black arms of his adversary wrapped around him	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1893
making him helpless as a babe	O O B-EMO O O O	sadness	1893
Then	O	sadness	1893
with a rush that sent every one flying out of his way	O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1893
Goliath hurled himself at the bulwarks	O O O O O O	sadness	1893
which were low	O O O	sadness	1893
the top of the rail about thirty-three inches from the deck	O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1893
The two bodies struck the rail with a heavy thud	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1893
instantly toppling overboard	O O O	sadness	1893
That broke the spell that bound everybody	O O O O O O O	sadness	1893
so that there was an instantaneous rush to the side	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1893
Only a hardly noticeable ripple remained on the surface of the placid sea.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1893
Next he attacked and killed Hather in Jutland	O O O O O O O O	anger	1894
and his fall is marked by the lasting name of the town	O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1894
After this he overthrew Hunding and Rorik	O O O O O O O	anger	1894
seized Leire	O O	anger	1894
and reunited the dismembered realm of Denmark into its original shape	O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1894
Then he found that Asmund	O O O O O	anger	1894
the King of the Wikars	O O O O O	anger	1894
had been deprived of his throne by his elder sister	O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1894
and	O	anger	1894
angered by such presumption on the part of a woman	B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	anger	1894
went to Norway with a single ship	O O O O O O O	anger	1894
while the war was still undecided	O O O O O O	anger	1894
to help him	O O O	anger	1894
The battle began	O O O	anger	1894
and	O	anger	1894
clothed in a purple cloak	O O O O O	anger	1894
with a coif broidered with gold	O O O O O O	anger	1894
and with his hair bound up	O O O O O O	anger	1894
he went against the enemy trusting not in arms	O O O O O O O O O	anger	1894
but in his silent certainty of his luck	O O O O O O O O	anger	1894
insomuch that he seemed dressed more for a feast than a fray.	O O O O O O O O O O O O	anger	1894
Then Thorkill	O O	happiness	1895
seeing that they were of two minds	O O O O O O O	happiness	1895
dispelled their hesitation to enter by manful encouragement	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1895
counselling them	O O	happiness	1895
to restrain themselves	O O O	happiness	1895
and not to touch any piece of gear in the house they were about to enter	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1895
albeit it seemed delightful to have or pleasant to behold	O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1895
to keep their hearts as far from all covetousness as from fear	O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1895
neither to desire what was pleasant to take	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1895
nor dread what was awful to look upon	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1895
though they should find themselves amidst abundance of both these things.	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1895
Thus SIWARD	O O	happiness	1897
by the sovereign vote of the whole Danish assembly	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1897
received the empire of his father	O O O O O O	happiness	1897
But after the defeats he had inflicted everywhere he was satisfied with the honour he received at home	O O O O O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1897
and liked better to be famous with the gown than with the sword.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1897
Straightway he sought medicine for his grief in loneliness	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1898
and patiently confined the grief of his sick soul within the walls of his house	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1898
But this bitter sorrow was driven out of him by the sudden arrival of Iwar	O O O B-EMO O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1898
who had been expelled from the kingdom	O O O O O O O	sadness	1898
For the Gauls had made him fly	O O O O O O O	sadness	1898
and had wrongfully bestowed royal power on a certain Ella	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1898
the son of Hame.	O O O O	sadness	1898
Poor lady	O O	fear	1900
she never knew how sore that boy's feet had been	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1900
nor how many times he had gone with half a meal or none at all	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1900
for fear of depleting too much the small store she had given him when he left home.	O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1900
Then	O	happiness	1901
to prevent any more troublesome business delaying his hopes of marriage	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1901
he went back to Gewar and enjoyed the coveted embraces of Nanna	O O O O O O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1901
Next	O	happiness	1901
having treated Helgi and Thora very generously	O O O O O O O	happiness	1901
he brought his new queen back to Sweden	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1901
being as much honoured by all for his victory as Balder was laughed at for his flight.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1901
But Odin	O O	disgust	1902
who had found that nothing served the wishes of lovers more than tough persistency	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1902
though he was stung with the shame of his double rebuff	O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	1902
nevertheless	O	disgust	1902
effacing the form he had worn before	O O O O O O O	disgust	1902
went to the king for the third time	O O O O O O O O	disgust	1902
professing the completest skill in soldiership.	O O O O O O	disgust	1902
So he besought them to make his son RORIK king	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1903
so that the judgment of wicked men should not transfer the royalty to strange and unknown houses	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1903
averring that he would reap more joy from the succession of his son than bitterness from his own impending death	O O O O O O B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O	happiness	1903
This request was speedily granted.	O O O O O	happiness	1903
Drawing him by those appeals	O O O O O	fear	1904
and warily noting the right spot to plant his blow	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1904
he turned the other edge of his sword to the front	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1904
fearing that the thin side of his blade was too frail for his strength	B-EMO O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1904
and smote with a piercing stroke through the prince's body	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1904
When Wermund heard it	O O O O	fear	1904
"he said that the sound of his sword ""Skrep"" had reached his ear for the second time."	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1904
He had several times taken caravans to Karague	O O O O O O O O	sadness	1905
and knew all the languages well	O O O O O O	sadness	1905
but unfortunately he afterwards proved to be what his name implied	O B-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1905
That	O	sadness	1905
however	O	sadness	1905
I could not foresee	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1905
so	O	sadness	1905
trusting to him and good-luck	O O O O O	sadness	1905
I commenced making fresh enlistments of porters	O O O O O O O	sadness	1905
but they came and went in the most tantalising manner	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1905
notwithstanding I offered three times the hire that any merchant could afford to give.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1905
This night one was shot	O O O O O	happiness	1906
without any mistake about it	O O O O O	happiness	1906
for the next morning we tracked him by his blood	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1906
and afterwards heard he had died of his wound	O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1906
The Wasui elders	O O O	happiness	1906
contrary to my expectation	O O O O	happiness	1906
then came and congratulated us on our success	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1906
They thought us most wonderful men	O O O O B-EMO O	happiness	1906
and possessed of supernatural powers	O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	happiness	1906
for the thief in question was a magician	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1906
who until now was thought to be invulnerable	O O O O O O O O	happiness	1906
Indeed	O	happiness	1906
they said Arabs with enormous caravans had often been plundered by these people	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1906
but though they had so many more guns than ourselves	O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1906
they never succeeded in killing one.	O O O O O O	happiness	1906
At his invitation we now crossed over the spur to the Ingezi Kagera side	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1907
when	O	surprise	1907
to surprise me	O B-EMO O	surprise	1907
the canoes I had come up the lake in appeared before us	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1907
They had gone out of the lake at its northern end	O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1907
paddled into	O O	surprise	1907
and then up the Kagera to where we stood	O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1907
showing	O	surprise	1907
by actual navigation	O O O	surprise	1907
the connection of these highland lakes with the rivers which drain the various spurs of the Mountains of the Moon.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1907
A man from Ruanda then told us of the Wilyanwantu (men-eaters)	O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1908
who disdained all food but human flesh	O O O O O O O	disgust	1908
and Rumanika confirmed the statement	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	disgust	1908
Though I felt very sceptical  about it	O O O O B-EMO O O O	disgust	1908
I could not help thinking it a curious coincidence that the position they were said to occupy agreed with Petherick's Nyam Nyams (men-eaters).	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	disgust	1908
No one knew of a lake to supply the waters	O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1909
nor where they came from	O O O O O	surprise	1909
That they flowed into the lake there was no doubt--as I could see by the trickling waters in some few places--and they lay exactly on the equator	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1909
Rising out of the valley	O O O O O	surprise	1909
I found all the country just as hilly as before	O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1909
but many of the rush-drains going to northward	O O O O O O O O	surprise	1909
and in the dells were such magnificent trees	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	surprise	1909
they quite took me by surprise	O O O O O B-EMO	surprise	1909
Clean-trunked	O	surprise	1909
they towered up just as so many great pillars	O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1909
and then spread out their high branches like a canopy over us	O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1909
I thought of the blue gums of Australia	O O O O O O O O	surprise	1909
and believed these would beat them.	O O O O O O	surprise	1909
This double failure was a more serious affair then a mere slight	O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1910
for my cows were eaten up	O O O O O O	sadness	1910
and my men clamouring incessantly for food	O O O O O O O	sadness	1910
"and though they might by orders help themselves ""ku n'yangania""--by seizing--from the Waganda"	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O	sadness	1910
it hurt my feelings so much to witness this	O B-EMO O O O O O O O	sadness	1910
that I tried from the first to dispense with it	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1910
telling the king I had always flogged my men for stealing	O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1910
and now he turned them into a pack of thieves.	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1910
About a year later	O O O O	sadness	1914
Mr Semple died	B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	sadness	1914
It was an untimely death	O O O O O	sadness	1914
one of those fortuitous and in a way insignificant episodes which are	O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1914
nevertheless	O	sadness	1914
dramatic in a dull way to those most concerned	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1914
He was seized with a cold in the chest late in the fall--one of those seizures ordinarily attributed to wet feet or to going out on a damp day without an overcoat--and had insisted on going to business when Mrs	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1914
Semple urged him to stay at home and recuperate	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1914
He was in his way a very determined person	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1914
not obstreperously so	O O O	sadness	1914
but quietly and under the surface	O O O O O O	sadness	1914
Business was a great urge	O O O O O	sadness	1914
He saw himself soon to be worth about fifty thousand dollars	O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1914
Then this cold--nine more days of pneumonia--and he was dead	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1914
The shoe store was closed for a few days	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1914
the house was full of sympathetic friends and church people	O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1914
There was a funeral	O O O O	sadness	1914
with burial service in the Callowhill Presbyterian Church	O O O O O O O O	sadness	1914
to which they belonged	O O O O	sadness	1914
and then he was buried	O O O O O	sadness	1914
Mrs	O	sadness	1914
Semple cried bitterly	O O O	sadness	1914
The shock of death affected her greatly and left her for a time in a depressed state	O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1914
A brother of hers	O O O O	sadness	1914
David Wiggin	O O	sadness	1914
undertook for the time being to run the shoe business for her	O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1914
There was no will	O O O O	sadness	1914
but in the final adjustment	O O O O O	sadness	1914
which included the sale of the shoe business	O O O O O O O O	sadness	1914
there being no desire on anybody's part to contest her right to all the property	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1914
she received over eighteen thousand dollars	O O O O O O	sadness	1914
She continued to reside in the Front Street house	O O O O O O O O O	sadness	1914

It was while he was calling on her in this way that his Uncle Seneca died in Cuba and left him fifteen thousand dollars	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1916
This money made him worth nearly twenty-five thousand dollars in his own right	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1916
and he knew exactly what to do with it	O O O O O O O O O	fear	1916
A panic had come since Mr Semple had died	O B-EMO O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU	fear	1916
which had illustrated to him very clearly what an uncertain thing the brokerage business was	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1916
There was really a severe business depression.	O O O O O O O	fear	1916
Either the well was very deep	O O O O O O	surprise	1917
or she fell very slowly	O O O O O	surprise	1917
for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen nextFirst	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1917
she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to	O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1917
but it was too dark to see anything	O O O O O O O O	surprise	1917
then she looked at the sides of the well	O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1917
and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves	O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1917
here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegsShe took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1917
it was labelled `ORANGE MARMALADE'	O O O O O	surprise	1917
but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody	O B-EMO I-EMO I-EMO I-EMO B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1917
so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it `Well	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1917
' thought Alice to herself	O O O O O	surprise	1917
`after such a fall as this	O O O O O O	surprise	1917
I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs	O O O O O O O O	surprise	1917

Why	O	surprise	1917
I wouldn't say anything about it	O O O O O O	surprise	1917
even if I fell off the top of the house	O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1917
And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high	O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1919
and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely gardenFirst	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1919
however	O	fear	1919
she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this	O O O O O O O O B-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU I-CAU O O O O B-EMO O O	fear	1919
`for it might end	O O O O	fear	1919
you know	O O	fear	1919

`in my going out altogether	O O O O O	fear	1919
like a candleI wonder what I should be like then	O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1919
' And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1919
for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing	O O O O O O O O O O O	fear	1919
Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1920
and found in it a very small cake	O O O O O O O O	surprise	1920
on which the words `EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants`Well	O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1920
I'll eat it	O O O	surprise	1920

`and if it makes me grow larger	O O O O O O O	surprise	1920
I can reach the key	O O O O O	surprise	1920
and if it makes me grow smaller	O O O O O O O	surprise	1920
I can creep under the door	O O O O O O	surprise	1920
so either way I'll get into the garden	O O O O O O O O	surprise	1920
and I don't care which happens	O O O O O O	surprise	1920

and said anxiously to herself	O O O O O	surprise	1920
`Which way	O O	surprise	1920

holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1920

this generally happens when one eats cake	O O O O O O O	surprise	1920
but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1920
that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1920
she set to work	O O O O	surprise	1920
and very soon finished off the cake.	O O O O O O O	surprise	1920

as briefly as possible	O O O O	happiness	1931
that I accompanied the engineer into the interior of the mine	O O O O O O O O O O O	happiness	1931

the chasm	O O	happiness	1933

in the depth of which - it  formed a dim vestibule - the raising of a curtain at the moment he  passed gave him a glimpse of an avenue of gloom with a glow of  tapers at the end.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O	surprise	1943
